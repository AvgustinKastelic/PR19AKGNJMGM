;8.01.2018 18:17;This is no more true for Lightning Network than for on-chain transactions. Lightning nodes could refuse to route your money, just like miners can refuse to confirm your transactions.

;29.01.2017 22:41;4) You can think of channel rebalancing as a sort of “liquidity injection” that stabilizes a poorly performing piece of the network.;;;;;;;;;
;29.01.2017 22:41;3) Forced channel closures, depending upon a variety of factors, may range from mildly annoying to nearly catastrophic.;;;;;;;;;

;22.01.2017 12:57;I can't make anyone do anything, I can only distill my own understanding for laymen. My support for Bitcoin XT had no discernable effect.;;;;;;;;;
;22.01.2017 12:38;I'm considering the various scenarios for nodes with low limits that are exceeded by miners. May merit a blog post to clarify.;;;;;;;;;
;22.01.2017 12:12;Also, your 2 choices are to either eventually accept the larger blocks from miners or to be forked off of the main chain. How is it bounded?;;;;;;;;;
;22.01.2017 12:10;My understanding is that BU downloads & stores every valid block it receives regardless of your local block limit. This is no longer true?;;;;;;;;;
;22.01.2017 12:06;Now the tables are turned and it's 4 weeks to enable SegWit vs many months to safely hard fork (if at all.);;;;;;;;;
;22.01.2017 04:19;Has anyone done the math on the worst case growth scenario? Could at least set a baseline from which to work backwards.;;;;;;;;;
;22.01.2017 04:03;I don't understand the claim that a BU node's local limit actually limits your cost. You have to eventually accept the larger blocks.;;;;;;;;;
;22.01.2017 03:58;The condition where miners keep increasing the size of the blocks they create well past the resource level for which I'm willing to pay.;;;;;;;;;
;22.01.2017 03:50;And maybe there's a flaw that can be exploited to crash every node on the network;;;;;;;;;
;22.01.2017 03:42;If so, maybe they were recently patched & we'll learn about them in a few years;;;;;;;;;
;22.01.2017 03:41;Yep. We're all looking for progress. A few years ago it looked like a simple hard fork block limit increase would be easier & faster...;;;;;;;;;
;22.01.2017 03:38;It's my personal opinion - I'm not willing to commit to an unknown unbounded cost. I suspect I'm not alone.;;;;;;;;;

;20.01.2017 19:54;Some light reading on the subject: https://medium.com/@lopp/to-node-or-not-to-node-48da1b6d7091#.7mxvntwac … http://www.coindesk.com/how-to-save-bitcoins-node-network-from-centralization/ …http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-security-model-deep-dive/ …;;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 19:50;The incentive is Bitcoin's security model. You need a full node for trustless financial sovereignty + superior privacy.;;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 17:37;In practice, nearly nonexistent on mainnet. OTOH, see reorgs hundreds & thousands of blocks long on testnet, often breaking stuff.;;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 17:05;At the node layer it's handled fine. But handling at the app layer and figuring out how to inform users is the pain.;;;;;;;;;

;20.01.2017 16:41;Which brings us full circle to the unanswered and possibly unanswerable question of acceptable cost of CONOP...;;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 16:40;I prefer free markets, but have to balance ability for individual to have financial sovereignty. I doubt democracy is the solution.;;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 16:33;Therein lies the crux of the debate. One pro of soft fork segwit is that it doesn't increase CONOP.;;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 16:31;So? How would that affect anyone who is following the chain with the most cumulative PoW?;;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 16:30;If block size isn't consensus, nodes can't enforce. You're saying a signaling mechanism vulnerable to Sybil attacks == consensus?;;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 16:28;It appears to me that the market has decided... to stick to 1 MB blocks. I can't stop the market.;;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 16:25;The (max) cost of each option is fairly clear. Removing block limit makes full & pruned node cost unclear.https://twitter.com/lopp/status/822464684183945217 …;;;;;;;;;

;20.01.2017 16:22;It would be preferable if every Bitcoin user could decide what cost they paid to run a node. Unfortunately we don't know if that's possible.;;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 16:19;You're claiming that segwit (activation or usage) can be Sybil attacked?;;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 16:16;OK, so the argument is that we can fall back to human consensus if needed. That is correct. It will also suck.;;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 16:15;Can you point me to the code where miners are counting node signals? I'd like to see how it resists Sybil attacks.;;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 16:03;Ever hear of a Sybil attack?;;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 16:02;Removing block size from consensus changes Bitcoin's balance of power & misaligns incentives, allowing miners to arbitrarily increase CONOP.;;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 15:59;"A @ BitcoinUnlimite node's self-configured size only works temporarily; with sufficient chain depth you must accept larger blocks";;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 15:57;"I doubt it - that's a worst case scenario; miners could easily self impose lower limits.";;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 15:39;I'd consider updating my Bitcoin nodes to support a hard fork up to perhaps 10MB. But asking me to support an uncapped cost is unreasonable.;;;;;;;;;

;20.01.2017 15:30;You may recall that I'm in favor of a hard fork. After the past year(s) I'm not seeing progress toward consensus...;;;;;;;;;

;20.01.2017 14:12;I suspect a market based limit would be increased until the pain is too much to handle. Hard to say how it would affect network.;;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 14:09;Yes, but it's clear now that a hard fork can't garner sufficient support. Last I checked, BU doesn't enforce a hard limit.;;;;;;;;;
;20.01.2017 12:09;That's the point - there is always a cost. Fundamental reason for debate is that no one can quantify the acceptable cost of node operation.;;;;;;;;;
