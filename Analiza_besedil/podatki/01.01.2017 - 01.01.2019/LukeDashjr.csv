LukeDashjr;31.12.2018 12:53;0;0;That's sarcasm, right?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.12.2018 08:19;0;0;Here's a good Q&A by Bishop Sanborn you should probably read: http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/SSPX_QA_RevPDF2.pdf …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.12.2018 08:18;0;0;"The one: Jesus established; Jesus made St. Peter the first pope of; seeks to proselytise the whole world; Pope Pius XII was the most recent pope; condemns heretic sects; condemns ecumenism; condemns religious liberty; condemns adultery; endorses capital punishment; etc";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.12.2018 08:02;3;43;I think you underestimate 2020.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.12.2018 07:58;0;4;"Fake muslim"" sounds about right. Muhammad waged war against Christians. People who oppose his example may be better people, but they're clearly NOT his followers. Islam is defined by Muhammad, hence ""fake muslim"" fits.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.12.2018 06:44;0;0;You sound confused. Catholicism is objective reality. Atheism is the brainwashing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.12.2018 04:53;0;0;"This is just the mass media trying to slander the real Church by referring to a heretic sect as the Catholic Church"". They have nothing to do with the Catholic Church in fact.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.12.2018 04:53;0;0;"Vatican City hasn't been under Catholic control since the 1950s. (It also begs the question whether money laundering"" is an actual problem.)""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.12.2018 04:50;0;0;The Crusades were good. While there were some abuses, those were by people NOT following the Church's teachings.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.12.2018 04:42;0;1;"Not in the slightest. The 666th commit was either 3f323a clipboard handling"" or 245ab4 ""add configure and receive icon"", both by @ orionwl. I have contributed around 130k lines of code.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.12.2018 03:38;0;1;The alternative is sin/evil, which God does not ask of us. God knows what is best, so acting morally will never be bad for us.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.12.2018 03:36;0;0;One doesn't need to be God himself, to follow God's teachings as revealed through the Catholic Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.12.2018 03:31;0;1;Following Catholic moral teachings will never result in bad life decisions or issues.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.12.2018 03:22;0;1;Sure, in fact that would be the default behaviour.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.12.2018 03:22;0;0;All over the world http://ecclesia.luxvera.org/Directory-World.html …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.12.2018 03:20;0;0;Nope, that's just what the mass media wants you to think.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.12.2018 01:50;0;0;The Church's perfection comes from God, not its own claims.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.12.2018 01:49;0;0;If you mean Francis, according to Catholic doctrine, he cannot be a pope under any circumstances short of conversion including a public abjuration of his heresies.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 19:57;0;1;Having a full node that you're not actively using isn't very helpful.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 17:40;0;0;I put it on my kids' phones once. Thought it was an emulator. Gameplay question was about Doom mods though;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 17:25;0;1;Of the same gameplay quality?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 17:10;0;1;Would be nice if Vorticons could be played with the newer engine? (Didn't try this yet) ... Or even use the most recent idTech engine for the games?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 17:09;0;0;That's the reality;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 16:59;0;1;That appears to be a rewrite, but conceded it may not matter for gameplay.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 16:57;0;1;That's fine. It is completely, seriously true.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 16:57;0;0;"It's shorter to just say Catholic""""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 16:03;0;2;No, actually, there were/are no problems with it, since the Church is perfect in its teaching of morals.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 16:02;0;0;Nope, Protestants reject Jesus Christ and replace Him with their own imagined alternative.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 04:21;0;1;No, that's you.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 03:53;0;0;Nothing has been added. Keep in mind the early Church preferred oral teaching, and generally only wrote when that was impractical. Also, due to persecution, it is likely we have lost quite a bit of writings that did exist.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 03:46;0;1;The problem is only when groups contradict their members' intentions. If the members are okay with it, there's no problem.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 03:45;0;1;No, it is *disobedience* to that moral doctrine. One might assume it implies a denial, but there is a fundamental difference between secret heresy and public heresy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 03:25;0;1;Immorality in general is not heresy. No pope ever taught heresy.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 03:11;0;0;AFAIK that can only be done in secret for privately held groups, in which case it's no different than the owner(s) choosing to do such contributions themselves?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 02:53;0;0;There is no reason government is obliged to treat groups the same as individuals. Restricting individuals and not groups would be difficult, but not the inverse.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 02:52;0;1;To correct @ RobinGibbons2's heresy that cardinals can make a heretic the pope.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.12.2018 00:56;0;4;Laws are not the problem, and do not cause lobbying much less misappropriation of funds for it. Corrupt organizations are the problem, and keeping them in check is obviously necessary.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.12.2018 23:10;0;2;No, it's better to get consensus on the concept before going to the step of technical design.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.12.2018 22:49;0;1;It's not something worth giving much thought to until we get consensus to make a change. Once we have that, we can study the merits of the different specific choices.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.12.2018 21:46;1;5;How about neither?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.12.2018 21:43;0;8;It does make some sense to limit financial contributions by non-individuals, at least. Far too often, groups act against their members' interests in this way.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.12.2018 21:29;0;1;The early Church believed the same things Catholics believe today.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.12.2018 20:51;0;0;scrypt is not designed for this purpose, and would make a terrible choice.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.12.2018 20:46;0;0;To be Catholic, one must assent to everything the Church teaches on matters of faith and morals. Not merely respect.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.12.2018 10:37;0;0;What intro?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.12.2018 09:50;0;1;AFAIK it's compatible with Catholicism. But it doesn't negate the necessity of being Catholic of course. http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10437a.htm …;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.12.2018 09:20;1;4;Catholics cannot disagree on doctrine. If one denies doctrine, he is no longer a Catholic.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.12.2018 07:53;0;1;Well, I have a spork and knife!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.12.2018 04:41;0;5;Just more mindless assertions... let me know when you have an actual argument.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.12.2018 04:29;0;8;You asked maximum, so I gave you maximum. And if we did a PoW change, we could likely solve the China problem.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.12.2018 04:20;0;10;So you don't have an argument?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 22:45;0;1;Looks like JSON...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 22:42;0;0;It's already known to me that vegan diets are unhealthy. Perhaps I could be convinced otherwise in some circumstances, but your other arguments are lacking enough that I think I would be wasting time looking into it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 12:16;0;1;Sounds like you're agreeing with me?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 10:58;1;11;Sounds like a good thing. Rape accusations don't need to be made in public - that's something that should be kept to the police and courts.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 10:56;0;0;"Fear of death,judgement&hell prompts one to repentance,and to the 1st efforts in acquiring virtue. Thoughts of the mercy of God produce hope,gratitude&correspondence.

LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 09:54;0;0;Sure, although you probably want to give it more thought than that, in case you might regret it later.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 09:51;0;0;Although MY cat is my property, so if YOU want to eat it, you better have my permission or at least be starving (in which case I am obliged to feed you, but even then, it's my choice what food).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 09:48;0;0;Nothing wrong with eating your cat, dog, horse, dolphin, monkey, etc.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 09:47;0;0;A couple of catechisms: http://www.baltimore-catechism.com/ http://catholicapologetics.info/thechurch/catechism/trentc.htm …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 09:46;0;0;"A catechism will go over the basics. Any unclarity is resolved by clergy, the highest authority of which is the Holy Office (now defunct, but has issued many historical declarations). Advanced study of morals conducted on a scientific basis is called moral theology""- books exist""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 09:33;0;1;The desire is to eat a steak, not to kill. Morals are objective, not subjective. The Bible isn't a moral guidebook, although one can easily show from it that we have explicit permission to kill and eat animals.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 09:29;0;0;Eating a steak is a purpose.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 09:25;0;0;Yes, let's ignore the health matter since it's irrelevant. Let's say I desire a nice steak. Maybe I don't need it, but that doesn't matter. The purpose in killing the cow is to eat a steak - not to inflict pain. Therefore, it is morally fine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 09:23;0;0;You're just denying reality now. You're not even making an argument.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 09:21;0;0;(If there is a purpose in causing the pain to animals, then it is morally fine to do so. There is no moral obligation to minimise or avoid the pain at all. Just as long as the pain is not the goal in of itself.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 09:19;0;0;I do in fact observe how they're raised. I can see them clearly from a place I go often. Animals are absolutely necessary for a healthy diet, and there is no reason to avoid them even if they weren't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 09:15;0;0;LOL what? Now it's gone from torture to killing? Animals have to be killed to eat them. That's how the world works. (Veganism is an unhealthy extreme.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 09:13;0;0;It's still a nuisance web video. I can observe how the plants and animals are grown at my local farms.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 09:09;0;0;War isn't animals. War is people. Emotions are not a tool for learning truth. They only cloud it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 09:01;0;0;Health concerns are another matter entirely, and why in practice I don't typically buy products produced that way. But it's totally unrelated to the fact that causing pain for animals is fine so long as there's a reason to do it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 08:58;0;0;Seeing something is entirely irrelevant to whether it is fine or not. Such an appeal has no purpose other than to try to override reason with emotions. (The actual reason I don't see it is because web video is a nuisance.) P.S. There's still no hypocrisy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 08:57;0;0;Children are that way because they have not yet developed their use of reason, and behave similarly to animals in that they act on emotion alone. For an adult, that would be a fault, not a good thing. P.S. I'm a convert. I wasn't raised Catholic.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 08:53;0;0;Thinking with just emotion is not a human quality.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 08:51;0;0;You're the one being emotionally irrational...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 08:44;0;0;Read the whole context. It's about assuming fault where there is no evidence of any. For example, if you see a young girl with a child, some people might jump to conclusions that she was guilty of fornication (but perhaps she was actually a rape victim).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 08:43;0;0;1) It is an invalid comparison. Slaves are in fact people, but animals are in fact not. 2) At the very least, they have no natural rights from God. We shouldn't torture animals, but that's not because they have rights. 3) It's not. Animal pain is fine so long as it has a purpose.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 08:21;0;0;The founder and leader (Jesus) is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 08:21;0;0;"Judgement is actually quite Christian. But making up imaginary sins"" is not.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 08:19;0;0;"Re slaves: Do you understand the difference between truth and falsehood? Re animal rights: *No* animals have rights. Re torture"": If it's preparation, it by definition is not torture.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 08:18;0;0;Now you're just slandering me. Goodbye.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 08:07;0;0;If the Catholic Church isn't divine, then I have no reason to care what the Bible says - it is just a bunch of words. The only reason to believe the Bible, is because the Catholic Church teaches it is of divine origin and inerrant.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 08:04;0;0;Everything in the New Testament (excluding the four gospels) is about the Catholic Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 08:03;0;0;1) This isn't slave labour. It's just animals, not people. 2) Slave labour would presumably be involved in the preparation of the product. Torture isn't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 08:02;0;0;Catholicism is for everyone. Regardless of what individual Catholics may or may not have done, Catholicism itself is perfect, since God revealed it to mankind and leads the Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 08:00;0;0;The Catholic Church is not a human organization. It is God's religion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 07:59;0;0;If it's not part of the food prep, it has nothing to do with me. I just buy food from them (at most).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 07:58;0;0;No, the problem is that God never intended it to be used that way.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 07:52;0;0;God gives us the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church gave us the Bible. Protestants revolted against God and twist the Bible.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 07:50;0;0;Yes. Hence why no two people who do what you suggest ever come away with the same doctrine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 07:46;0;0;God reveals things through His Church, not directly to individuals.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 07:45;0;0;"Pretty much. Either the torture"" is part of preparing it as food (in which case, it's not torture, and is moral), or it isn't (in which case, it's not implicating me in any sense).""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 07:39;0;0;Uh, I don't torture animals. If I did, that would be hypocrisy. But I don't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 07:24;0;0;Nothing hypocritical about it. It is indeed wrong to literally torture animals, but making efficient use of them is not torture. http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04542a.htm …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 07:09;0;0;You are full of heresy. I'm done wasting time with you.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 07:08;0;0;"Yes, immorality is defined as disobedience to God. Only God knows the why"" answer behind many things. You are just a mere human - who are you to question God? Animals aren't even people.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 06:58;0;0;No, you are twisting Scripture.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 06:58;0;0;No, it wasn't legal, because the government did not have authority to make such a law.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 06:48;0;0;1) Jesus IS God. 2) Despite being infinitely superior to them, Jesus never disobeyed His parents.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 06:47;0;0;"Your conscience is something formed by your parents and society. It is not objective. Without God, nobody has any authority to enforce their morals"" on anyone else, not even prohibition of murder and such.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 06:46;0;0;All governments receive authority from God. The sect with pedophile problems is the Modernists, not the Catholic Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 06:45;0;0;Evil is defined as disobedience to God. God cannot be evil. That would be a contradiction.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 06:45;0;0;Galileo was treated justly AFAIK.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 06:44;0;0;"If the government makes a law saying murderers get hung, they have authority to do so. It is a just law. Obey. If the government makes a law saying Catholics get hung, they don't have that authority. It is an unjust law"", and not really a law at all. Disobey.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 05:56;0;0;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13598b.htm …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 05:48;0;0;You've been fed a bunch of garbage. That isn't what happened.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 05:47;0;0;No, maybe you should try to read what I actually said.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 05:27;0;0;No, it didn't. The Catholic Church has been significantly responsible for the progress of science. To take your own example, Fr. Copernicus was a Catholic priest. (Galileo was also a Catholic, but anti-science, as he wanted to push his hypothesis without evidence.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 05:25;0;0;But I don't recognise that as part of the government's authority. Unjust laws are outside the government's authority, not part of it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 05:18;0;0;You keep throwing around ad hominems, yet you're the one who is completely wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2018 05:15;0;0;Thinking for yourself, and doing an honest study of religions and reality, leads to the conclusion that Catholicism is correct.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;27.12.2018 02:52;0;1;Catholic doctrine holds that one cannot be a pope unless he is a member of the Church, and that one cannot be a member of the Church unless he holds to the Catholic Faith in its entirety. John XXIII (papal claimant of 1958) and his successors publicly deny(ed) Catholic doctrine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.12.2018 02:50;0;7;I don't think that's relevant to my point (since I'm apparently the most senior Bitcoin developer at this point).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.12.2018 02:48;0;1;Catholic teaching is that no formal declaration is needed for loss of office or recognising such a loss.

LukeDashjr;27.12.2018 02:46;5;11;Benedict is a heretic, so per Catholic teaching he could not have become pope, not even with the unanimous consent of cardinals, and whether or not the heresy was ever formally declared (Pp.

LukeDashjr;26.12.2018 22:55;0;1;No, I'm saying the lower 35% after the bottom 15% but before the average, are NOT pulling it down because they're not included in the average. And they won't pull it up - if that were the case, they wouldn't be below average.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.12.2018 22:51;0;2;Perhaps I was unclear. I don't mean 15th percentile sorted by absolute speed, but 15th percentile sorted by rate of speed improvement.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.12.2018 22:51;0;2;If we need 85% of the economy to use their own full node, it isn't sufficient to just be usable with average bandwidth improvements - we need to be usable with the bandwidth improvements 85% will be able to realise in practice.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.12.2018 22:49;0;3;No, that's not relevant. The point is we don't *need* to care about whether the bottom 15% can run a full node. (Maybe it'd be nice if they could, but it's not a *necessary* thing.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.12.2018 22:48;0;1;I think you're both saying the same thing...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.12.2018 22:43;0;2;(Yes, it's possible 17% may actually be *too aggressive* an assumption once you consider the 15th percentile aspect... but nobody wants to consider that );;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.12.2018 22:40;0;1;That's average speeds, and it hasn't historically been that high. Look at some of the older studies, eg https://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=493;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.12.2018 22:02;0;2;What we need to look at is the change in the 15th percentile of residential speeds (possibly just first-world countries, if we assume they will have much more economic value than others).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.12.2018 21:41;0;2;At least 85%. So to be at a safe level today, with 63k full nodes, there would need to be no more than 74k actively dealing in bitcoins.

LukeDashjr;26.12.2018 08:37;0;3;Yes, so long as it is a pruned FULL node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.12.2018 08:28;0;0;Pretty sure there actually isn't an infallible list of popes. Even Catholic sources admit the early records are unclear, and that the criteria for appending to the list has changed over the centuries.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.12.2018 01:53;0;3;Keep in mind that Bitcoin's own systemic security depends on the majority of people in its economy using their own full node. Without that, it effectively turns into a fiat currency (and you actually *lose* security by using a full node in such a minority).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.12.2018 01:52;0;2;No, the Blockstream satellite only works for new blocks, not IBD. It's also a centralised service, so not something anyone should be relying on. Pre-synced nodes are a security danger. A compromised pre-synced node is undetectable without a full sync.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.12.2018 01:50;0;4;At least some people have already given up hope, and are planning for a future where Bitcoin security must be compromised.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.12.2018 01:42;0;5;But Bitcoin's own network-wide security relies on people using it securely, so it's NOT okay if most people don't run their own full node.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 23:57;1;27;Recently, I've begun giving educational talks about Bitcoin technology. Is this helpful, or should I focus on just coding?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 23:32;0;1;Bitcoin is already NOT fine. Less than 100k full nodes, and dropping. At least a supermajority of the economy needs to be using their own full node for Bitcoin in general to be secure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 23:31;0;1;Hmm, do mnemonics use less entropy, or am I missing something?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 23:20;0;0;dumpmasterprivkey;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 23:15;0;4;It will take years (decades?) before the cross-over point where improvements catch up to IBD growth. Considering the dire situation we have already, it seems improbable (note: not impossible) Bitcoin will survive to that time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 23:13;0;1;You can't verify your funds without your own full node.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 23:10;0;0;Assuming the products work as designed, you do. But there's no guarantee you received them in the first place until you validate it using a full node of your own. (If you're sending to yourself, you can trust yourself, provided the origin was verified.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 23:09;0;0;If you don't have any change, perhaps it's sufficient. But even if your recipient accepts your payment, if he's not using his own full node, it creates economic pressure to remove the rules of Bitcoin, thus enabling inflation, theft, etc.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 23:06;0;0;Just because you CAN do something, doesn't mean you should. There are reasons Core's wallet works the way it does.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 22:42;0;4;Using it isn't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 22:39;3;19;Consider it your daily reminder to use your own full node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 22:34;0;2;The question is if you have any bitcoins in your mobile wallet in the first place.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 22:33;0;1;I wouldn't. I'd continue to use Bitcoin Knots.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 22:31;0;6;Yes, that's beside the point: the poll seem to be encouraging not using a full node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 22:29;0;1;Having custody of your own keys isn't much if you can't determine if those keys control any real bitcoins or not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 22:29;0;2;That's a reasonable approach, but unfortunately tends to be difficult for most people (although I don't know if Wasabi or Cold card might make it easier?) 4 options for a poll like this is the root problem. But at the very least one of the options should be an easy full node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 22:18;0;2;But the choices above are not full nodes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 22:18;0;0;Yes;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 22:14;0;17;Totally defeats the point if people are just using light wallets... PoK remains a bad joke.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 20:29;0;0;Anyway, the point still stands that no matter how you look at it, it's NOT a 20% tax. 20% of inflation is some much smaller fraction of the total.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 20:02;0;0;Usually a tax is a transfer of owned money from one person to another entity. While there is an argument that inflation may be considered a tax, usually that inflation is not determined at the launch of the currency. Additionally, the tax % is never based on % of inflation rcvd.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 19:59;0;2;The Holy Inquisition was a court established by the Church for hearing cases of religious crimes. Compared to the civil courts, it was a huge leap forward in terms of justice and fairness. So much so that those accused of secular crimes would often utter heresy to get a transfer.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 19:58;0;1;The Catholic Encyclopedia has an excellent article covering the topic of indulgences: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07783a.htm …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 07:48;0;5;Consider: Why would miners mine Bitcoin instead of the 2012 forkcoin that continued the 50 BTC subsidy onward? (Because the latter has no market value...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 07:45;0;4;It might not be a weird choice if that's what the market values.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 07:44;0;3;That implies someone else has a right to the supply at all. It would be completely ethical for 100% of the supply to initially go to the development, assuming it's disclosed to potential users. As for what % those potential users will tolerate before forking off... who knows.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 07:40;0;0;That's how Catholics are obliged to look at it. It is heresy to say a heretic can be a pope. It is also obligatory for Catholics to follow and obey a pope.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 07:38;0;0;There is no pope at present.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 07:35;0;0;No, that's why there isn't a pope right now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 07:30;0;0;(Not to be confused with bad Christians/Catholics, who do believe but falter in practicing.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 07:26;0;0;They may pretend to be part of it, but they are not actually.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 07:23;0;0;That's a lie.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 07:23;0;0;There's 17 verses that make up the Ten Commandments. Nothing was deleted. Protestants just re-grouped (and corrupted) them in order to fit their agenda.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 07:20;0;0;The second commandment is against taking the Lord's name in vain. The prohibition of idolatry is the first commandment.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 07:19;0;0;No commandments have been removed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 06:51;0;1;Note most of the important materials are available online these days. (I'm not sure I'd include Trent's catechism on the list of stuff relevant for the question at hand, although it's definitely good to go over);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 06:19;0;0;Validity of a Sacrament depends on matter, form, and intent. Not authority. Authority is what provides licity. And in the case of a vacancy of the Holy See, there are well-defined rules.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 06:00;0;0;If it was, then all Sacraments would cease in between popes... which clearly is not the case historically.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 05:11;0;4;"If 20% of inflation going to fund development is a 20% dev tax, then it only makes sense that the remaining 80% is a 80% miner tax. Bitcoin has no dev tax"", but it still has the miner ""tax"" at 100%.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 05:05;0;0;I am giving you an example of applying Catholic teaching. One that clearly doesn't require consulting clergy about. The point is that laity SHOULD and DO apply Catholic teaching.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 05:04;0;0;I didn't say people had to use Zcash.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 05:03;0;0;With regard to the V2 sect, there is only one way to apply the Catholic *doctrine* that heretics cannot be popes. (Canon Law doesn't really even enter into this.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 05:01;0;0;Miners are not special.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 05:01;0;5;(By that logic, Bitcoin has a 100% tax...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 05:00;0;1;The difference is between whether it's the initial supply, or taken post-supply.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 05:00;1;5;20% of the coin supply sounds reasonable. There's really no reason to be giving coins exclusively to miners. Yes, there are practical problems (what if the devs get lazy?), but that doesn't make it an unreasonable concept.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 04:52;0;7;Indeed, it is. (Is it really 20% tax on everyone? Not just 20% of inflation?);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 04:49;0;0;No, laymen are expected to apply Catholic teaching every day in our daily lives. Do you need a priest to tell you not to kill someone? This is no different.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 04:24;0;2;While there is lack of clarity on how to restore the papacy, there is no unclarity with regard to the fact that the V2 antipopes cannot be popes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 04:23;0;2;The papacy has no superior. Both clergy and laity alike are inferiors in this context.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 04:01;0;0;Cum Ex is pretty clear.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 03:56;0;0;IMO, Akita seems highly unlikely to be the real BVM. The Church generally doesn't endorse apparitions in general, not even while approving of them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 03:30;0;0;Finally, if it is the truth, it probably refers to a future pope. Just because we have no pope today does not mean that will continue until the end of time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 03:28;0;1;"First and foremost, note that no private revelation is binding. It cannot be used as a justification for disregarding doctrine. Also, the third secret is not known. The Modernists revealed"" the version you refer to, but it is highly suspect and doesn't match prior statements.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 03:25;0;0;Catholics have never tolerated idolatry.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 01:42;0;0;If you refer to the Sabbath, Christ showed His displeasure with it, and the Apostles abrogated it. Regardless, the specifics there are a matter of discipline/laws, not doctrine/beliefs;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 01:38;0;0;The institution of the Catholic Church is the Body of Christ. One cannot be part of the institution, without being a Christian.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 01:36;0;1;With regard to the papacy, private individuals can make a formal judgement no more OR LESS than bishops and cardinals can. The first See is judged by none. Now the question for you: why did the Church teach that a heretic cannot be pope, if applying this doctrine is impossible?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 01:35;0;0;Welcome to 1990?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 01:32;0;0;"It's a theological position, yes, but to say Francis is pope is also logically incompatible with being a Catholic.

LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 01:29;1;2;That's not a question that needs to be answered to admit the fact that the Modernists are not popes. Nor is it one that us laity need concern ourselves with, as it seems exclusively a matter for clergy to deal with.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.12.2018 01:12;0;2;The Church has always taught they people affiliated with false religions can be saved in exceptional circumstances DESPITE those false religions. The difference is that the Modernists teach that the false religions themselves are good and can merit salvation.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.12.2018 04:24;0;2;Wrong. The original release of Bitcoin had a much lower limit, but measured in UTXO changes, not serialized bytes (similar to how Segwit has moved back to a weight limit).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.12.2018 04:09;0;1;Bitcoin never, at any time, had unlimited blocks. And anyone with a clue knows that's insane.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2018 03:59;0;12;Sadly, too much of the Bitcoin community has been led to believe bigger blocks are better.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2018 03:30;0;0;If you desire/will evil, it is a sin for which you will be punished (or forgiven) whether or not you are able to act on it.

LukeDashjr;20.12.2018 21:51;0;0;No, a miner making an invalid block isn't a fork at all (at least not in the same meaning as soft/hard forks). The change where a formerly valid block becomes invalid is the definition of a soft fork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2018 21:49;0;0;The ability to act freely. As opposed to free will, which is the ability to will/desire freely.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 21:21;0;3;Just one year is going to be 35-40% longer. In 3 years, it will be 200-250% longer.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 21:20;0;5;In terms of bandwidth/CPU/IO for the initial sync. Pruning does not reduce this. Storage has NEVER been a concern.

LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 21:19;0;1;I/O and bandwidth too, depending.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 21:08;0;1;You're looking at the wrong variables. It's not the block size that can increase by 17%, it's the block*chain* size.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 21:07;0;2;Yes, it is necessary. If you're not using your own full node, you're not using Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 21:00;0;1;The goal would be to evaluate and consider extending it longer (perhaps with more specific parameters and growth).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 20:51;0;2;Yes, we don't want to get locked into something only to find out later it's a problem. During the trial period, we can also study the exact metrics better and get a long-term plan in place for max weight/size.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 20:50;0;5;Initial sync time is basically the only thing relevant at this point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 20:45;1;3;Reducing the limit is only a softfork. Current block sizes are unsustainably large, growing the blockchain faster than technology can keep up with.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 20:42;0;0;The status quo has changed. The limit is no longer 1 MB as when that was written.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 20:39;0;0;No, block sizes are the rate of change. So 300k blocks add 300k per 10 minutes, instead of 2-4 MB per 10 minutes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 20:38;0;0;300k is the rate of technology improvements. I've seen no indication the rate has changed. And worse, the status quo has gotten worse since blocks have been exceeding that rate for years now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 20:37;0;0;Scaling can be accomplished by reducing the block space consumed per transaction. Lightning is a huge leap in this direction, effectively giving infinite tx/s by replacing the tx/s limit with instead a limit of users onboarded per second.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 20:35;0;2;You're looking at block size limit it is the resource. It's not. The block*chain* is the resource. Block size is the rate of growth. 2-4 MB blocks are a 50-100% increase over the next year. Technology improvement only tends to be around 17% per year.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 20:34;0;0;That's something they can do without any community action.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 20:31;0;4;Reducing one implies reducing the other (more or less);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 20:30;0;1;Technology improvements have been sufficient to sustain 300k blocks.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 20:28;1;4;Reducing the block size limit is a softfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 20:26;0;4;The block size limit is already 2-4 MB, not 1 MB. And improvements to computers/bandwidth only accounts for 300k blocks. It cannot keep up with larger.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 20:25;0;11;It's fairly simple to make a softfork temporary. Just have it so that once a certain block height is achieved, it automatically deactivates.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 19:58;0;2;Reducing block sizes will indeed reduce initial sync duration/cost over time. That's the whole point of doing it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 19:40;0;2;Not AFAIK. It would be helpful for someone to do an organized study to get more up-to-date and scientific numbers, rather than just the estimate I think we've been using so far.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 19:37;1;7;It doesn't actually reduce bandwidth required to run a full node. You can already do better with -blocksonly mode. (And despite apparent confusion: it doesn't help initial sync at all);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 19:35;0;7;1) This does not make the initial sync any more efficient at all. It only reduces bandwidth for already-synced nodes. 2) The evidence for a blocksize decrease already assumes tech (including software) continues to improve.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 04:02;0;1;It's not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 03:59;0;0;Usually they just trust people. If they suspect you, you better be prepared to prove you're innocent, though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 03:46;0;4;The point is that withdrawls *aren't* sales.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 03:41;0;1;"Also, victims don't ever see a dime of these loans"". They don't get to spend it on pizza or beer. It goes directly and exclusively toward the universities.""";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 03:38;0;1;It's NOT a sell, and Coinbase is lying to the IRS if they report is as such.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2018 03:37;0;7;No, you can just report when you do finally sell/spend...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 22:58;1;14;Your English is great...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 21:28;0;1;It shouldn't be considered a solution.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 21:27;0;0;That's part of the scam.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 21:04;0;2;It's easier to softfork than to hardfork, so if we overshoot, we can softfork to a lower limit [schedule] as needed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 21:03;0;1;Not if planned in advance.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 20:18;0;1;Not in theory, just in practice in modern-day schools. You'd learn more studying on your own nowadays.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 19:37;0;0;Okay, then how about the fact that for the last few decades, 100% of clergy adhering to and teaching the Catholic Faith reject Paul VI's claim too? Universal rejection, if you will...?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 19:36;0;5;"Regardless of who holds"" the ""contracts"", it is undeniable that the universities and the loan sharks are intertwined and collaborating on the scam.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 19:32;0;0;But the Church does not adhere to Francis in the first place. 100% of clergy who recognise Francis a pope, are themselves heretics or schismatics, and therefore outside the Church. The clergy who uphold the Catholic Faith all reject Francis's claim to the papacy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 17:30;0;0;What?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 17:07;0;2;Recalculating the safe block size would only make sense if the current blockchain size was safe, but we've been beyond that point for a while now;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 17:00;0;2;"I don't think anyone has given a we are okay"" statement... That would be concerning. As for why give up - I'm not sure I can blame them. Educating the community is a very uphill mission, and it may already be too late.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 16:57;0;5;More like *stopping at* only 2 children is mentally bad for you. Once you get *beyond* 2, it relieves the pressure and gets easier.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 16:55;1;3;If we're going to have democracy anyway, it actually does make sense to give votes to children (only?). Their parents should be filling out the ballot, though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 16:53;4;73;It's not legitimate debt. Modern universities have become little more than a government-backed scam.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 16:52;0;2;The current chain is almost 200 GB, and growing at a rate of about 100 GB/year... Mere data downloads are not comparable at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 16:20;0;0;Not implementing BIP148 was even more dangerous, so that reason doesn't really apply.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 16:14;0;0;"Yes, but BIP148 also had sufficient community support and Core"" dropped the ball on it.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 16:10;0;0;Yes, as long as it stops at 4 MWU.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 16:09;0;3;"Core"" hasn't even implemented softforks *with* community support. Most likely this will take a UASF fork, even once we get to that point.""";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 05:11;1;3;Where is the source code for the CLI version?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 01:37;0;0;You don't need incoming connections to run a full node either. (But you also don't need a static IP to get incoming connections.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 01:35;0;0;There isn't community support to reduce block sizes yet. Some other devs have basically given up hope in this regard.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 01:33;0;2;Doesn't look comparable. The key feature of Patreon is that it's recurring...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 00:30;0;0;No? It's an objective fact* and mathematics. * Except for the fact that there's no guarantee future improvements will keep pace with past ones, but that risk doesn't support larger blocks, only smaller ones.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 00:28;0;0;More than one per person (or company) is typically unhelpful.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 00:16;0;0;To maintain the security status quo, blocks need to be 300k. Technological progress DOES NOT balance any larger scale. As things stand with the block size status quo, next year, it's 50% (minus 17.7%) *worse* than today.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 00:06;1;5;A year from today, the blockchain will be 50% larger, while a new computer on an updated internet connection will only be 17% faster.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2018 00:01;0;0;600kWU limit seems appropriate.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2018 23:57;0;1;Not 100% sure, but we've already begun to go down that road.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2018 23:55;0;2;Fewer and fewer people will be using full nodes, and eventually Bitcoin will become just another centralised fiat currency we trust someone not to inflate/steal/etc.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2018 23:54;0;2;Yes, most likely it wouldn't need to be a fixed block size long-term. For starters, I would only suggest we impose a new limit over 6 months and then revert back to the 4MWU limit pending further evaluation of the results.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2018 23:46;0;1;It's very unlikely, and you don't account for the fact that the blockchain size is already getting unbearably large. Even if we catch up in a decade, it won't matter because it won't be managable long before then.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2018 23:34;0;3;For such a formal thing, I'd really like to get concrete measurements of the tech improvements. Say, for example, benchmarking IBD on dedicated 2011-era hardware, then again on dedicated 2018-era hardware. Perhaps RPi1 vs the current RPi as well. Can others help with that step?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2018 23:29;0;5;Your response doesn't make sense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2018 22:57;0;3;Using Segwit enables miners to produce larger blocks, and isn't needed for typical wallets. Avoiding Segwit, on the other hand, helps keep block sizes lower.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2018 22:55;0;1;600kWU seems like a reasonable limit (typical block size w/ segwit being around 300k);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2018 22:54;0;3;No, Segwit was/is needed for Lightning, which is crucial to scaling, and future improvements. I accepted the bundled block size increase as a compromise, although now I think it may have been a mistake even then. I *am* against *using* Segwit for non-Lightning wallets, tho;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2018 22:23;0;5;Miners can set a fee floor by simply not accepting transactions paying too little.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2018 22:20;0;2;Fees aren't something we can or should try to manage. The cost to use a decentralised system is what it is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2018 22:18;0;5;With block sizes larger than 300k, the initial sync time continues to increase. With 300k, technology improves fast enough to maintain the status quo. Keep in mind the biggest security risk to Bitcoin today is that too few people run their own full node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2018 22:17;1;24;Yes, it seems many people (including other devs) have just given up entirely on Bitcoin maintaining the same security model. But it's not too late to get back on track, and we only need a large enough minority (and a smaller minority opposing) to do something about it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2018 22:14;1;5;Not really. It's pretty simple math, though. Over the past ~decade, technology has only improved at a rate of around 17% per year. The equivalent increase in blockchain size is a 300k block size.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2018 22:12;0;2;Nope, never said anything similar to that. The rare occasion like this that I even mention the topic, I have always been harshly condemning it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;17.12.2018 20:38;0;2;It's not a decision. It's an observable fact. Did Catholics wait for Rome's declaration before they stopped attending Anglican parishes? No.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;12.12.2018 04:29;0;0;They deny the Church's teaching on Baptism of desire. They also deny the Church's teaching that participating in (what they consider to be) non-Catholic religious services is a mortal sin.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;12.12.2018 04:12;0;0;That's just plain false. The Church has always taught BoD, and defined at least that it is a thing at Trent.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.12.2018 04:00;0;0;And don't forget the Church has also defined Baptism of desire doctrinally too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.12.2018 03:59;0;0;Culpability plays a role.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.12.2018 03:46;0;0;Nope, but only God knows if they died outside the Church or not. Just because someone adamantly insists they are outside doesn't mean God considers them outside.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.12.2018 03:43;0;0;No, that's a *conclusion* YOU are drawing, not a teaching of the Church itself. But you and I are mere men, and cannot ever come close to understanding the mind of God. He alone is the Judge as to Church membership and salvation in general.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.12.2018 03:28;0;0;Yes, I do. I believe everything the Church teaches.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.12.2018 03:19;0;0;We can never say for certain the Judgement of God for a particular person, short of divine revelation specific to that person.

LukeDashjr;12.12.2018 03:00;0;0;That's Catholic dogma, so yes. (But God is the final Judge on who is part of the Church.);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;11.12.2018 18:47;0;1;Sure;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;11.12.2018 16:09;0;0;The early Anglican Masses were undeniably valid, but it was still condemned to attend them. The same applies here (and *on top of that*, the Novus Ordo offends God, is invalid, and is performed by invalidly ordained clergy).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.12.2018 16:07;0;0;"The absence of the essential form does make it invalid, as does the fact that the priests"" saying it are not validly ordained.

LukeDashjr;11.12.2018 15:59;0;0;There is nothing heretical about it. It is nothing more than the Catholic religion, which must be held in its entirety to be a Catholic person.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.12.2018 15:54;0;0;Sarah, Burke, and Ratzinger are non-Catholic heretic frauds. They have no authority whatsoever.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.12.2018 15:53;0;1;I'm not saying the lower side of us isn't useful, only that it should not be given unrestrained control over our lives.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.12.2018 15:51;0;0;Also, literally every single bishop who holds firm to the Catholic Faith today, will tell you that you should never under any conditions participate in a Novus Ordo. That's basically as authoritative as it gets under these circumstances.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.12.2018 15:48;0;0;"The necessary form of consecration is well-defined. The condemnation of attending non-Catholic services is also well-defined and has many precedents.

LukeDashjr;11.12.2018 15:28;0;0;"It is also the fact that the clergy"" doing it are not Catholics. Even if it were 100% undoubtfully valid, Catholics could STILL not go to it. For example, many SSPX Masses are valid, but Catholics should never go to them.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.12.2018 15:27;0;0;Stay home, watch a Mass-cam, and pray the missal (and rosary of course). Attending the Novus Ordo does NOT fulfil your Sunday obligation, and is of NEGATIVE value.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.12.2018 15:16;0;1;They're both centralised. It's also not important. Bitcoin unaffected.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.12.2018 22:57;0;0;Oh, feel free to give information. My point is that there's no problem with using and slaughtering animals for food. That's literally what they're for.

LukeDashjr;5.12.2018 16:25;0;1;I can't. There's no way to know if a node on Tor is Tor-only or not.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.12.2018 16:09;0;6;It's already a problem. There's under 100k full nodes. Unless there's fewer than ~115k people using bitcoins, that's dangerous to Bitcoin's security.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.12.2018 01:36;0;0;Yes, it is. Half the victims are male. Besides, one doesn't need to be a victim (and certainly not a perpetrator!) to take a stand against crime.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.12.2018 00:26;1;1;Bitcoin isn't an entity, so it can't really have a monopoly per se.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.12.2018 00:26;0;1;I realise you probably just meant to use me as a hypothetical example, but FWIW, I have not had this problem with Google myself.

LukeDashjr;3.12.2018 00:03;0;0;No need to imply. There is no salvation outside the Catholic Church, the ark of salvation established by God as the ONLY means by which humans can save their souls.

LukeDashjr;2.12.2018 23:59;0;0;Clinton would have been far far worse. As it turns out, Trump hasn't been so bad (at least compared to my expectations).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.12.2018 23:43;0;0;Facts are facts, even if society denies them. Besides, the majority of America is pro-life, and enforced the laws against abortion up until the corrupt Supreme Court overruled the democracy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.12.2018 23:42;0;0;But it's not just a claim. It's scientifically proven.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.12.2018 23:42;0;2;You clearly haven't bothered to go through my Twitter history, because if you had, you'd see that I *do* condemn Trump's faults. Even ones you probably don't even think about (his fake marriage to Melania...);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.12.2018 18:31;0;0;Government has a duty to prosecute and punish murderers. Explicit refusal to do so makes them culpable.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.12.2018 17:37;0;1;Abortion is the intentional killing of another living human being. Murder is everyone's business.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.12.2018 17:35;0;0;Reality is universal, including the natural law that abortion is prohibited. Government has an obligation to prosecute and cannot legitimately legalise it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.12.2018 17:32;0;0;Only IPv4 nodes are included. I can't detect if the same node is the same one across protocols, so I just ignore other protocols.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.12.2018 15:50;0;1;Why are you trying to waste my time implicitly disputing facts that the Obamas publicly admitted to?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.12.2018 15:43;0;0;Morality is objective. Just because you deny the FACT that abortion is murder doesn't change the reality that it is. Nor does it change or remove the grave duty that the government has to prosecute such murderers.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.12.2018 15:40;0;1;I wasn't defending...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.12.2018 15:36;0;1;For searching, @ DuckDuckGo. For email, @ Postfix, Courier IMAPd, and TDE's KMail.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.12.2018 15:33;0;2;"I guess you're interpreting it differently from me, but I don't see how. If the words moral scandal"" means the Evangelicals didn't get upset over it, then there isn't such a ""moral scandal"" for Trump's adultery either...""";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.12.2018 15:29;0;0;Go through my long Twitter history if you like. I have more than once condemned Trump's adultery, including his relationship with Melania (which is not a real marriage, since he already married Ivana).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.12.2018 15:22;0;5;No, I don't defend Evangelical heretics either. I just found it ridiculous that Mr. Pavlovitz is trying to portray Obama as a moral person, even beyond reproach.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.12.2018 15:16;0;0;For example, how do we know if Mr. Roeder was simply acting as an ad-hoc State executing Mr. Tiller for his serial murders?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;1.12.2018 21:47;0;0;No, regardless of which of Giacomo or I are correct, the position that the State has no authority in principle is certainly wrong.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;1.12.2018 17:40;0;17;Putting them all in the same chart with the same scale seems like it would be a more useful comparison...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;1.12.2018 12:46;0;13;Nice. In the US, you have to hold it for over 1 year just to QUALIFY for capital gains taxes - any less time, and it's considered regular income (and taxed at an even higher rate).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;1.12.2018 09:26;0;9;Prior art for a component used in a patent doesn't invalidate the patent. Although from skimming an article about the patent, it seems likely their entire patents are trying to claim things Bitcoin has done for years anyway.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;1.12.2018 09:17;0;3;Due process is important. This flips the burden of proof. When prosecuting the falsely accused, the burden of proof lies on the accuser.

LukeDashjr;30.11.2018 19:37;0;2;Just don't let it get unbalanced in the first place. Open new channels rather than let that happen. And you can incentivise routing through you with negative fees.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.11.2018 15:35;0;0;I think the crowd on Twitter is actually being more probing than an expert witness needs to be for a jury. The jury doesn't care why/how, just what the facts are.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.11.2018 15:29;0;2;For example (to avoid using live services), a MtGox customer can sign for any of his MtGox addresses, but just because you got a transaction consuming a UTXO in the MtGox wallet doesn't mean the address signer is the one who sent the funds.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.11.2018 15:27;0;16;There should probably be a law forbidding discrimination against people you have failed to defraud in the past.

LukeDashjr;30.11.2018 15:20;0;2;Having the private key is possession of funds in such UTXOs, but owning the address does not imply you own the UTXOs nor the private key.

LukeDashjr;30.11.2018 15:16;0;1;Because signmessage proves you own the *address*, NOT the private key. You may very well not have access to the private key, and the UTXOs controlled by that key may quite possibly be of a larger value than your entire holdings.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.11.2018 07:35;0;2;Addresses are an abstraction that only exist in the scope of #3.

LukeDashjr;30.11.2018 07:34;2;5;For a given Bitcoin transaction, three things happen: 1) The consumed TXOs are no longer valid. 2) New UTXOs are created, locked by a given key/script. 3) The recipient(s) owning the addresses paid get credited bitcoins.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.11.2018 07:30;0;1;No, because spending has nothing to do with the address.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.11.2018 03:24;0;0;(1) is false. The address is an opaque identifier for the recipient [and purpose] of the transaction. That it is [sometimes] implemented using a hash of the public key is irrelevant. It's just an implementation detail.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 22:14;0;1;Addresses and keys are two distinct things.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 15:49;0;1;The Thai baht is not Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 08:48;2;4;Because the destination address indicates the recipient of the first transaction, but the UTXOs created by it are not tied to that address/recipient, and the recipient is not necessarily involved in the second transaction at all.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:33;0;0;I have no idea what you're even talking about. What boxes?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:32;0;2;Receiving bitcoins does not help you identify anyone, not even the exchange.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:28;0;0;Keys are not addresses.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:27;0;1;That they're associated with ransomware and/or donation addresses doesn't mean they're not with an exchange.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:26;1;6;In China? I doubt it's just there...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:23;0;0;The way Mr. McElrath is interpreting it, it already IS taint tracking. I haven't seen any indication the government itself interprets it this way, though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:21;0;1;Note I didn't actually perform any attacks, just had like 99% hashrate.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:20;0;0;Okay, but my point still stands. As a recipient, you have no indication who sent the transaction or what addresses they own. (Except what you know out-of-band, which is more likely a name than an identifiable address or set of addresses.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:17;0;1;Well, in this case, you couldn't have known.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:17;1;2;But miners don't actually process transactions in the traditional-money sense. The transactions are valid whether or not they're mined. Also, once any miner includes it in a block, ALL future blocks MUST do so as well.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:15;0;0;"Pedantic"" only refers to irrelevant distinctions.

LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:13;0;2;Nobody receiving bitcoins has any evidence it came from someone who owns a given address. (Addresses are only owned, not controlled.) If you know it came from a named person on the list, that's another matter you need to consider, yes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:11;0;1;The only way to engage in a transaction with an address, is by sending to it. Receiving *never* involves engagement with an address other than your own.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:11;0;2;They have no way to know which it is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:10;0;0;Addresses don't spend UTXOs. They only receive.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:08;0;2;For example, maybe those are the criminal's MtGox addresses. The criminal therefore doesn't possess the UTXOs nor the private key to spend any UTXOs. When the criminal withdraws or spends his bitcoins, they will probably NOT use those same UTXOs. If someone else spends, it might.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:06;0;1;No, we don't know the criminal ever possessed any keys or had control over any specific UTXOs.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:05;0;0;"Legal ownership is the only thing the criminal had, and not over specific bitcoins, but just some amount of bitcoins in general.

LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:04;0;1;Miners aren't a party to transactions they confirm.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:03;0;2;If they don't care about taint, then they don't care about transactions you receive.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:03;0;1;In this scenario, the criminal never possessed them, only owned them, and not even specific bitcoins - just *some* bitcoins.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:02;0;1;Where did OFAC say people should implement taint stuff? AFAIK, they just barred transactions with an address. That doesn't imply taint nonsense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:01;0;1;Blockchain forensics and guesswork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 06:01;0;2;Regardless, Bitcoin addresses do not indicate possession, they indicate ownership.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:56;0;1;I already did. You just apparently fail at reading.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:55;0;1;If you possessed them, you could. See MtGox.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:54;0;0;No, it isn't false.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:53;0;1;Addresses are opaque identifiers for the recipient. The public/private keypair is a component of the wallet, which is not necessarily the recipient. A spend of the UTXO could be from any other random person, not necessarily the person who received when that UTXO was created.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:50;0;1;The person who sent the bitcoins is not necessarily related to the bad actor in any way. It's no different than any other random Bitcoin transaction.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:47;0;2;You don't know that. He might never have had the private key.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:47;0;1;If the Feds want to be notified of arbitrary transactions that don't have anything to do with the address in question, they should say that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:41;0;1;No, there is no indication that the criminal is involved in transaction B in any sense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:30;0;2;Now transaction B is consuming that UTXO. But transaction B has nothing to do with 1somebadaddress at all, despite that address having received bitcoins at the same time as the UTXO was created.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:30;0;1;Let's say transaction A sends to 1somebadaddress. That address indicates the new owner of the bitcoins (who may or may not possess them). The transaction also creates a UTXO with a given txid/index serial number, which belongs to the wallet possessing the bitcoins (not the owner);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:24;0;5;Hardware advances have historically only been sufficient to justify/sustain 300k block sizes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:23;0;1;Businesses that lie to you shouldn't matter. Jumping through hoops to get an unrelated address also shouldn't matter.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:15;0;1;The transaction we're talking about has nothing to do with the addresses flagged by OFAC. So where do they say they want to know about it? How is the average Joe supposed to know which arbitrary transactions OFAC wants to know about in the first place?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:14;0;1;That's why we need to reduce block sizes: so that it stops getting harder (maybe even starts getting easier).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:11;0;1;Or just a webwallet the criminal used at one time. Where does OFAC say they want you to inform them even if you receive a transaction that has nothing to do with the address in question?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:10;0;3;It's not getting easier. It's getting harder.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:07;0;0;That's my hope.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:06;0;4;You can't even know you have ANY bitcoins, unless you use your own full node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:06;0;0;To save bandwidth, yes, but if you don't have the bandwidth in the first place, you have no way to handle a bad satellite.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:05;1;7;No, it doesn't. The address indicates the owner, but the key/signature is a matter of possession, not ownership. There is no way (using public information) to prove that the possessor is also the owner, and that is very often NOT the case.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:03;0;0;Reducing to 100k or 200k would help us catch up quicker, if there is consensus for that. But before going that far, it seems better to just try 300k for a year (or maybe even a few months). At least that slows the damage while we evaluate pros/cons.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:02;0;0;As far as reducing not helping the current size issue: we're NEVER going to catch up technologically, so long as we are continually making the problem worse and worse.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 05:00;0;0;That's called trusting miners.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 04:58;0;2;Where does OFAC say that and why? Such a transaction is NOT from the address in question.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 04:57;0;1;The problem is what happens if Blockstream goes rogue, or their satellites get hijacked?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 04:55;0;5;You mean outputs. But that address is not related to the input consuming the UTXO.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 04:52;0;2;If there was, we wouldn't need an initial sync at all. That's literally all it exists for.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 04:51;0;6;Inputs don't have addresses.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 04:51;0;0;You can't prove you 1) run a full node, 2) run it at home, or 3) use it for transactions. So there's no way to do this. For now, the reward is actually being able to use Bitcoin (without a full node, you don't really get Bitcoin's benefits).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 04:49;0;0;"Don't confuse pruned nodes (which are still full nodes) with the idea of a new node that is based on a trusted pre-pruned"" state.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 04:36;0;1;Hence, blocks are way too big.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 04:35;0;3;That's only 3 TBC!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 04:29;0;0;(Note that decreasing the number of full nodes is the PROBLEM...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 04:28;0;0;Yes, you can verify a pruned state by downloading and processing the full blockchain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 04:10;1;5;They're essentially guessing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 04:09;0;6;You'd have to ask them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 04:08;1;10;Because unless a supermajority of Bitcoin economic activity actually uses their own full node, the system is insecure and basically doesn't work. Not *everyone* needs to run a full node, but the percent who do so today is far too low and dropping.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 04:05;0;1;Even erroneous case law would not change what the correct judgement SHOULD be. For example, Roe v Wade was a gravely erroneous judgement, and abortionists SHOULD be ruled guilty of murder.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 04:03;2;20;In other words, any time you see a block explorer claiming a transaction came FROM some address, that is nothing more than erroneous misinformation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 04:03;0;0;You're not providing goods or services to Bitcoin addresses (unless you're sending to them). I've already said multiple times that this doesn't help you with regard to the prohibitions to deal with specific people/entities (which aren't conceptually new).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 04:01;2;19;For any given Bitcoin transaction, there is a set of consumed UTXOs (which do not have addresses or any other personal identification associated with them) and a set of destination addresses being paid. Bitcoin addresses do not exist outside the scope of a destination.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 03:55;0;0;That's why it's not legal advice.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 03:54;0;0;Yet it's also the reality.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 03:54;0;1;There's no comparison. If you're receiving a transaction, you're not interacting with ANY Bitcoin address (other than your own). You may have trouble due to the prohibitions to transact with a specific person/entity, but that's another matter.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 03:33;5;40;If your government forbids you from knowingly transacting with certain addresses, it SHOULD be sufficient to just never send to those addresses.

LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 03:33;48;201;Reminder: Bitcoin transactions are never *from* an address, only *to* them.

LukeDashjr;29.11.2018 03:17;2;19;This doesn't make sense, since you don't receive Bitcoin from an address. There is no sender identification at all. Bitcoin addresses are only used for the *destination* of a transfer, not the source.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.11.2018 17:35;0;1;That's not how faith works.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.11.2018 17:22;0;0;Just because God obliges does not justify the evil done by humans. Basically IVF is the same as rape. (No doubt I'm terrible at trying to explain this, but I don't know a good source to link.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.11.2018 17:22;0;0;The creation of humans is an action performed by God Himself, but which we are permitted to cooperate with Him in through marital relations. Any attempt to create humans outside of this is immoral.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.11.2018 17:16;0;0;(Also, denying God exists is just plain delusional, considering how well-proven His existence is.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.11.2018 17:15;0;0;You're the one coming to false conclusions. Without God, there is no morality whatsoever, and no reason to behave as if there is. There is no reason to care about others' desires at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.11.2018 17:12;0;0;Killing innocent human beings is immoral because only God has the right to kill humans, and He does not delegate that authority insofar as innocent humans are concerned. This is the only real reason murder is wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.11.2018 17:10;0;1;IVF is immoral, and not a valid metric to judge the availability of eggs. Many children are conceived and born every day.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.11.2018 17:07;0;0;People are not property. And eggs are not scarce - almost every woman has plenty.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.11.2018 17:07;0;0;That does not logically follow. Killing innocent human beings is immoral no matter what their desires or lack thereof. Humans are not mere flies.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.11.2018 16:32;1;3;My full node does not identify it as such to the public. And if people find it and try to abuse it in such a manner, I reserve the right to start injecting bogus transactions to ensure they stop.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.11.2018 16:10;0;1;Perhaps I am missing a specific context then.

LukeDashjr;28.11.2018 16:07;0;2;Yes, if you don't use it with your own full node. You don't need that security if it's your own node you're talking to. Your node is providing the security in that case.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.11.2018 15:59;0;3;That's more like theory, not reality. In reality, AIUI from @ kanzure, it's actually about *murdering* kids who have such predispositions or diseases.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.11.2018 15:54;0;1;(Perhaps not so blind, since you do need to make sure your node is actually trustworthy. But the point is that there's no real need for SPV or other such partial or full proofs when querying it.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.11.2018 15:44;0;1;"A lot of people gave them a second chance after the wallet is actually just blindly trusting http://blockchain.info "" debacle. So losing trust once isn't the end. But the repeated pattern might suggest they don't deserve it.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.11.2018 15:43;0;0;This has nothing to do with how you construct transactions...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.11.2018 15:42;0;5;I'm saying blindly trusting your own node is perfectly secure and private. The important thing is that it's YOUR node.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.11.2018 15:39;0;2;Ah, I understand the context now. :) P2PKH and P2WPKH (which are a subset of Bech32) use approximately the same actual space, but P2PKH uses more weight, disallowing miners from making larger blocks.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.11.2018 01:41;0;0;Not really. They use Intel CPUs, which are either backdoored (Intel ME), or vulnerable (without ME, security patches cannot be applied). Additionally, much of the CPU firmware is closed source, so you can't really be sure what else it's doing.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 05:42;0;2;5) Their current software does NOT implement a full node, so is of questionable relevance as it's essentially a light client. 6) There are only about 32 of their nodes running on the network, total.

LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 05:40;0;2;3) The last version Satoshi was involved in, in any sense, was v0.3.20. It makes literally no sense to pick v0.5. 4) IIRC, they didn't even start with the last v0.5 release (v0.5.7 or v0.5.8rc3 depending on if you count RCs), which makes even LESS sense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 05:40;0;3;1) Satoshi did not hand off management to any one person or group. That is true. (But also irrelevant) 2) Anyone can develop Bitcoin software, including the folks at # bitcoin-markets;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 04:56;0;1;The problem is with spammers, and miners choosing to put that spam in blocks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 04:55;0;1;That volume you're talking about is on exchanges, not the blockchain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 04:50;0;2;Yes, that's caused by others sending spam with a higher feerate.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 04:45;0;1;It's up to miners to decide how many and what transactions they put in their mempool. Nothing to do with price.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 04:43;0;1;No, it isn't. Spam is easily defined, and a necessary concept to even approach this subject.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 04:42;0;2;Price is correlated to fees because fees are measured in bitcoins, not dollars. Also, correlation doesn't mean causation. Price increases unfortunately enrich spammers, who then spend their money on spamming. So if there is a causal relationship, it is spam following price.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 04:35;0;1;4) A hardfork can do nothing about the sizes of peoples' mempools or price. 5) Blocks were full in January because of spam, not legitimate usage.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 04:35;0;0;1) Every node has its own mempool. If it gets too big, that's on the node operator, nobody else. 2) Again, price has nothing to do with block sizes. Nor with the size of someone's mempool. 3) Price has NO MAXIMUM. (At least not one defined by Bitcoin.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 04:30;0;1;You don't know what you're talking about.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 04:06;0;1;?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 04:00;0;4;Price is unlikely to have anything to do with block sizes, and in any case not a justification for making changes to Bitcoin. A block size increase of ANY kind needs consensus (but no, the increase bundled with Segwit was a one-time opportunity).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 03:52;2;3;1) Jihan was enabled by a bug in SHA256 that made it de facto ASIC-resistant.

LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 03:43;0;4;Is this opposites day? ASIC-resistance is a bad thing (it gives a bigger advantage to people who make the ASICs anyway), and block sizes need to be decreased.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 03:15;0;2;It's not an alternative to everyone running full nodes. Without that, the situation is even worse regardless of mining decentralisation.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 00:09;0;2;Nah, you just want to play word games. Everyone with a bit of common sense knows the difference between health and crime.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.11.2018 00:00;1;11;v0.1 had a TXO change limit, which effectively limited block sizes to about 500k. So 1 MB blocks would not be accepted by v0.1. (The hardfork to remove that limit, raising it to the 1 MB block size, was in 2013 May, v0.8.);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;18.11.2018 10:03;0;1;I don't claim to fully understand the exact criteria when a law is just or unjust, but I am pretty sure your blanket statement is false. It would seem to reject the concept of positive law, which certainly exists.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.11.2018 09:53;0;1;Threatening and acting to punish criminals is a legitimate use of that authority as well. It may be violence, but the violence is the fault of the criminal, not the government.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.11.2018 09:53;0;0;Legitimate authority comes from God. Any government functioning for the general well-being of its citizens has such [limited] authority.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.11.2018 09:51;0;0;"It is morally wrong to disobey just laws, even if the just laws do not exactly mirror another moral law.

LukeDashjr;18.11.2018 09:45;0;1;Therein lies your problem. You fail to recognise the difference between abuse of power, and legitimate authority.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.11.2018 09:45;0;0;No, because if you disobey, you are still doing something wrong, whether it is enforced or not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.11.2018 09:41;0;0;But the government is not a robber. We have an obligation to obey the law, even if no threats are made. In fact, if threats or violence is actually needed, that could imply someone *disobeyed*, and thus the violence is THEIR fault, not the government's.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.11.2018 09:39;0;0;You don't need to want to obey, to choose to obey. Nor is it voluntary so long as there is an obligation to obey.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.11.2018 09:37;0;0;No, it doesn't. So long as those other people wilfully obey, no violence or threats are needed. The real world typically works this way.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.11.2018 09:32;0;0;(The answer is that nobody tries to stop you from speaking. Similarly, if everyone obeys and nobody tries to disobey the law, no violence is needed to govern.);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;18.11.2018 04:58;2;39;Voting is work, not leisure. Maybe there's an argument to have some mandatory paid time off, but it certainly isn't a holiday.

LukeDashjr;18.11.2018 04:53;1;5;This is racist and partisan. How about instead, you focus on teaching under-educated Americans (of any race) basic common sense principles and logic?

LukeDashjr;17.11.2018 07:31;0;2;It kindof is. For those bitcoins to be spent, someone has to pay for it in labour, goods, or services (ie, accepting bitcoins as payment). Thus, it is technically a form of debt - debt that everyone who accepts bitcoins as payment freely takes on.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;17.11.2018 02:03;0;0;(Yes, there are tricks to limit exposure to cross-application attacks, but not ones that are easily usable by most people.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.11.2018 02:02;0;1;Backdooring ANY software effectively gives you access to ALL software on the same system (on a non-mobile OS).

LukeDashjr;17.11.2018 00:54;0;1;Bootstrapping is all I was trying to use it for (and it didn't succeed). Shouldn't need to bootstrap on backdoored hardware either, so portability should be fixed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 20:56;0;1;I have a PR to BIP 8 fixing this issue here:https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/550 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 20:56;0;0;If users choose to reject a softfork, they ought to also reject the chain with the mandatory signalling upfront. Thus, mandatory signalling sets a clear indication of which chain has deployed the softfork, and which one has not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 20:54;0;0;Yes, if a miner violates the rule, you very quickly find out which other nodes are enforcing it. Short of that, the only way to even have an *expectation* is for something mine block signalling to indicate that by continuing on that chain, you accept the softfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 20:50;0;1;That would be one way to solve this, yes. (Preferably written in a language I already have a secure compiler for, so I can avoid the whole recursive compiling solution.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 20:43;0;1;I can't even run software written in the language, because I have no secure way to compile it. Not sure it's fair to blame the software written in Rust for this issue, though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 20:37;0;0;It lacks mandatory signalling, so there's no way to evaluate even IF a softfork has been successful or not. They would remain in limbo basically forever.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 20:34;0;0;(As for other possible production-unreadiness, that's not something I can reasonably evaluate without having a working Rust compiler.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 20:31;0;0;Note that GitHub is NOT the preferred way to report security issues.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 20:30;0;0;If it can't be used for software on secure systems, then yes, it's not production ready.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 20:29;0;0;BIP9 is dead, and BIP8 was (and hopefully never will be) never used.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 20:27;1;3;Ah, you mean 0.15.0 where the reject changed to a corrupt-and-accept. Yes, that would have been a hardfork *if it had consensus*. But it didn't have consensus.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 20:25;1;2;Okay, so 0.14.3 / 0.15.2 / 0.16.3 then. The assertion became a clean reject. That's not a fork at all, just node stability. 0.15.2 / 0.16.3 also changed a silent corrupt-and-accept to a rejection. That's a softfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 20:20;0;1;For IBD you don't need to worry about invalid chains. It only matters to look at the present.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 20:19;0;0;The ongoing impact is that initial sync continues to get worse and worse, and new users continue to choose not to run full nodes, contributing to insecurity of the network.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 08:35;0;0;IIRC, it doesn't do MW unless you bundle it with an extension block.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 07:50;0;2;No. It's also impossible with a softfork. At best, you might get consensus to add MW as an extension block.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 07:40;0;1;MimbleWimble?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 05:57;0;2;"That's tied to new full nodes. If new people can't run full nodes, they will run light wallets instead, and that is a vote"" to hardfork to ""miners may inflate, steal, etc"" So long as blocks are >300k, sync time will get longer and longer even after accounting for improvements.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 05:42;0;8;Whether it is or isn't, it's irrelevant. Miners are not the weak link. New full nodes are.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 05:37;0;2;(That works out to be just over 300k/block.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 05:36;1;29;Block size isn't directly comparable to bandwidth. Bandwidth is a rate of transfer, while block size is a rate of growth of the data that needs to be transferred (the blockchain). Therefore, we need blocks to be a size that fits within the *rate of bandwidth increases*.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 03:39;0;11;Considering the very great harm being done by our current ~2 MB blocks, clearly any increase would also be at least as harmful.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;16.11.2018 00:15;0;2;It's not possible to compile Rust code, without trusting a third-party Rust compiler binary. There is only one Rust compiler, and it is itself written in Rust, so a recursive backdoor cannot be ruled out.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;12.11.2018 07:39;0;0;If you don't want to be shot, your only real way to avoid it is to carry and shoot first. By doing so, you also reduce your risk of being mugged or murdered using other weapons.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;12.11.2018 07:31;0;0;Yes, that's why you only need to nominate someone decent to beat him, not someone good. If you nominate someone even less decent than Trump, Trump's gonna win again.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2018 07:30;0;0;It doesn't reduce mag capacity, it prevents one from buying/selling the guns with mags over that capacity, thus reducing the guns available on the [non-black] market.

LukeDashjr;12.11.2018 07:19;0;0;My point exactly. Guns reduce crime.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;12.11.2018 07:15;0;0;Nope, I'd be voting for Trump again. You need to nominate some DECENT candidates if you want to win, not more of the same evil extremists.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2018 07:10;0;0;The alternative is that the attacker has a strong advantage over his victim. The value of a gun is that it evens the odds out.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2018 07:10;0;0;Cruise missiles don't help you fight off an attacker.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2018 07:09;0;0;I don't really have a good natural-rights argument against banning large (or even medium) capacity magazines. Just that it seems an excuse politicians use to make guns in general harder to get, since it reduces availability significantly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2018 07:07;0;0;Well, it's only going to work if you have enough users/defenders willing to mine against such attacks. But at least there won't be ASICs disadvantaging the good guys...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;12.11.2018 06:07;0;1;No, he's making the point that criminals don't follow laws. They only restrict the good guys. Good things, like guns, should therefore not be banned.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2018 05:54;0;0;Even if it was a shooting every hour, it wouldn't change the fact that people have a right to defend themselves with a gun. (Also, correlation is not causation. But again, besides the point.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2018 04:18;0;0;No, it's in your head. And again, it doesn't matter. Rights are rights regardless of what the outcome is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2018 03:59;0;1;It doesn't matter.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 08:17;0;2;"You definitely can use it in a home defense situation. It's just not as effective as a shotgun. What is unsportmanlike conduct"" supposed to mean? I wouldn't even consider anything less than a semi-automatic for hunting.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 08:16;0;0;Semi-automatic rifles are the normal rifle. They are useful in all cases that any rifle is useful. The only way to get a not-even-semi-automatic rifle is to go to bolt-action, where you manually load each round by hand.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 08:15;0;0;One can never be certain of that, and there are always alternatives with modern medical care. But yes, even if the doctors told us it was a high probability, we would have to come to peace with it. Murdering someone is never a legitimate choice.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 08:13;0;0;The child ages from the moment he begins life (which we know from science to be conception). You can't kill someone who's already dead. Killing someone to save your own life is wrong and generally illegal except when they actively and intentionally are harming you at that time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 08:10;0;0;People make a decision to become parents when they have sexual relations. Even in the minority of cases where a mother doesn't make the decision (rape), she still has the obligation to provide for the ordinary needs of her child(ren).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 08:07;0;0;Abortion is literally no different from the Holocaust. You're saying it's no big deal if we elect Hitler because he likes mass murder.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 08:06;0;2;"Overkill"" how? It's just a normal rifle.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 08:05;0;0;Semi-automatic rifles are your normal off-the-shelf rifle. Now if you want to argue rifles in general don't have a defensive use... I'm not sure I have an argument against that. But that doesn't mean I want them banned either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 08:01;0;0;No, it doesn't prove your point. Abortions at ANY age are murder.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 08:00;0;0;Even at 1 day since conception, most children can survive just fine without any medical intervention in their mothers' womb (which they have a right to the usage of).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 07:58;0;0;His official policies already disregard the Constitution.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 07:57;0;0;That's exactly what politicians do...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 07:56;0;2;Probably 10 rounds is more than sufficient for self-defense. (If you have more than 4 or 5 attackers, a gun won't help you anyway.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 07:55;0;0;I'm talking about ordinary semi-automatic guns like the AR15. Bump stocks are already illegal. If you're really up to it, you can make your own machine guns from scratch...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 07:46;0;0;For example, https://floridaabortion.com/ They don't use guns, obviously, but that doesn't make it any less murder.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 07:44;0;0;Living children, yes. Perhaps not breathing, but that's irrelevant. They're surviving just fine with ZERO medical intervention, even.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 07:44;0;0;Right now you can, but I suspect that'd be unlikely to last long with Gillum in charge.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 07:43;0;3;"He wants to ban normal guns (which he calls assault weapons"" to make them sound bad), and is proud of having ""beat the gun lobby"". People suffering from mental illness have rights too, but I won't pretend that isn't a complicated scenario to deal with.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 07:30;0;0;Refusing to prosecute them at all. There is plenty of proof in most cases. They kill openly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 07:28;0;0;Far more children are massacred with abortion than any other method.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 07:27;0;0;Trump may be evil in his personal life, but when it comes to government policies, yes, Gillum and Clinton are far, far worse.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 07:26;0;3;Another obvious one is that he wants to make it harder for law-abiding citizens to exercise their fundamental human right to defend themselves from assault, in some cases making it impossible. As if we haven't had enough problems with citizens being unarmed and unable to defend.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 07:25;0;3;Let's see... most obvious is that he wants to enable the massacre of unborn children, not only refusing to prosecute offenders, but also subsidizing their crimes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 07:19;0;3;"He seems to have gone out of his way to hide the Issues"" page he used to have on his campaign website... even http://archive.org can't bring it up.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 07:14;0;0;Okay, so what is 45?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 07:06;0;3;What is 47-2? Gillum and Clinton would certainly be terribly bad for Americans and Floridians, though. It's amazing how they can get people to vote against their own interests.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 06:23;0;1;The real guy is using it to play Pokemon Go on like 11 accounts.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 06:22;0;4;It looks like you're playing Pokemon Go on those...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 06:06;0;0;(Whether the claim is true or not is irrelevant. The point is that they aren't saying we should disregard legitimate votes.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 05:59;0;0;"Are you really this dense? The problem is there's allegedly a room full of Democrats fabricating new votes"" to make sure Gillum wins. The time it takes them to fill out the ballots is why the ""counting"" is delayed. These aren't legitimate votes. (At least that's the claim.)""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 05:17;0;2;I suspect if asking was all it took, @ RaptorEng would have already gotten them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 04:53;0;2;Sure, it could definitely be much worse. I'm just saying it's not *fully* FLOSS.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 04:48;0;2;Block diagrams are not wiring. Each one of those blocks has thousands of transistors implementing them. Only @ IBMPowerSystems could provide more detailed wiring, and I think they charge $$$ for that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 04:35;0;1;We don't have the wiring inside the POWER9 CPU itself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 04:19;1;34;The fact that Trump was our best candidate in 2016 may indeed be an embarrassment, but nowhere near the embarrassment that Clinton and you actually managed to get a competitive number of votes. How do you get nearly half of Floridians (or Americans) to vote for such evil people?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 03:44;0;0;"Nobody is justifying that. The mean comment"", however, WAS justifying rape.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2018 03:10;0;0;@ WrathOfMoe Why did you like this comment? *You're* the one justifying rape, not I.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 20:49;1;2;How is this any worse than modern politics where the entire success of a campaign is measured in $ raised? I don't see a way around the fact that to make the vote unprovable, you also void the citizens' own ability to prove it was counted correctly to themselves.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 20:45;0;24;Can I identify as a person from the Middle Ages, and legally force anyone interacting with me to behave as if it were in fact the Middle Ages?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 20:42;0;1;I think that one loses the auditable property.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 20:41;0;0;No idea, I haven't done any notable research into this. But with modern smartphones being flashable with open source firmware, I would have to guess the spying stuff is in the proprietary modem (which typically gets direct hard-wired access to the microphone).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 20:37;3;13;Just have the government issue a hardware-wallet-like device to each living social security number, and broadcast the vote signatures to everyone. (I'm sure there's a way to anonymise the votes too.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 20:33;5;24;It's kind of hard to believe online voting could be much worse. (Obviously don't use a blockchain... but normal asymmetric cryptography should do fine) Disclaimer: I still don't support democracy.https://twitter.com/varin/status/1060937524040884224 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 20:16;0;5;Don't have an Echo, but phones have the same problem... IIRC, even old non-smart phones were found to be streaming audio when powered off. (The trick back then was to remove the battery, but smartphones don't let you do that anymore.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 05:59;0;1;I'm not a cypherpunk. While I think there may be some possibility for cryptocurrency to change politics for the better, I don't expect Bitcoin specifically (nor any other cryptocurrency that exists yet) would have such an effect.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 05:47;0;0;Probably, but when voting, all we can do is try to avoid the worst outcome.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 04:03;0;0;What? You really think there are nearly 2 million bitcoin hodlers? In Canada alone? That would mean under 5% full node usage, which means Bitcoin is centralised. Let's hope not.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 02:34;0;0;Denying the scientific fact that they are won't change that fact. Goodbye.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 02:27;0;0;Science doesn't support your argument. Nor does the Bible say pedophilia isn't wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 02:26;0;0;Neither of those are relevant to the fact that the baby is a living human being from the moment of conception.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 01:49;0;1;Protesting is a waste of time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 01:49;0;0;Objectively, it is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 01:26;1;2;No, He flooded it for the crimes of adults. And justice is not the same thing as murder in any case.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 01:23;1;5;Lip service isn't much better, though. Why would God give blessings to a nation that is constantly murdering His little ones?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 01:18;0;1;Accidental death does not justify murder.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 01:17;0;2;Yes;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2018 01:17;0;0;Vigilantism is not the same thing as due process and justice.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 23:22;0;1;Yes, they are murderers. Maybe someone else did the actual killing, but they took out the hit on their baby. There is no right to murder your child.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 22:52;0;1;Regardless of what politicians intended, the fundamental human right is for self-defense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 22:47;0;1;Yes, it's good to kill murderers, provided due process is followed. Totally different from killing innocent children.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 22:09;0;0;Then you disagree with objective reality. Delusions and denial of facts are not a reasonable basis for law. P.S. Children can't survive w/o assistance even after birth.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 22:08;0;1;Maybe they think that if you lose more than that, you were being a fool? Probably the number was set a long time ago and needs bumping up...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 22:04;0;1;I thought you could claim the loss?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 22:01;0;1;"(Interestingly, it actually IS considered murder even by US courts. The Supreme Court merely decided in Roe v Wade that the mother's right to privacy"" trumped the child's right to life... but in cases where the mother wants the child, someone killing the baby is prosecutable)""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 21:59;0;0;My wife and I have offered to adopt children at risk of being murdered quite a few times, and not once has anyone taken us up on it. But at the end of the day, that's irrelevant, since the responsibility is the parents to provide care, not random other people to adopt.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 21:59;0;2;No, she cannot. Parents have a grave obligation to provide for the needs of their children. Sure, she can offer the baby for adoption when it is safe to do so, but until that is done, she must provide for his needs.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 21:57;0;0;It's not your body either. No child ever consented to being murdered.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 21:57;0;2;Absolutely not. Two wrongs don't make a right.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 21:56;0;1;It's not possible to restrict her will, but it certainly is possible to restrict her actions, or at least provide a consequence for such actions. Murdering an innocent victim is not an acceptable solution to his father committing a crime.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 21:54;0;1;In 1175, we didn't know when life began. Now we do. Again, it's NOT her body.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 21:53;0;0;Catholicism is objective reality. Atheism is the fairytale. If you studied biology, you would know that human life begins at conception.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 21:03;0;0;Sure it is. Even as far back as the book of Acts we can see St. Peter exercising that authority.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 20:42;0;0;"Nope, the Apostles all believed in ultramontanism"", as did their successors for 1000 years before the Orthodox decided to deny it.""";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 20:16;0;4;It's not her body either. She doesn't have a say. Who does have a say? God charged the government with duty to protect people. You are the one walking the path to Hell.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 20:02;0;0;"Preeminent among the apostles"" is not the extent of papal primacy. The pope has universal jurisdiction, and is the superior to all other bishops.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 20:01;0;0;Indeed, He did.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 19:45;1;0;Orthodox initially started by denying the primacy of the popes, and have since then gone on to corrupt a number of other doctrines. For example, they even allow divorce and remarriage.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 19:34;1;6;I don't think the premise (that prediction markets can predict good outcomes) holds. Inevitably, it seems like just a form of rule-by-the-rich.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 19:33;1;1;Depends on the circumstances.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 19:17;0;0;Obviously the preference is for them to convert.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 19:09;0;1;Maybe. Something like the cars only accepting upgrades the government has cryptographically signed as licensed? (Although I don't like the idea, it's better than the status quo.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 19:07;0;0;No, they are false religions that lead to Hell.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 19:00;0;1;Animals aren't people. I don't support war. Abortion is the murder of a human being, no different than drowning a 2 year old.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 18:15;0;2;It's not really a matter of opinion. It is a fact that nodes which don't enforce Segwit, are NOT full nodes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 18:13;0;0;Wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2018 17:33;0;0;There is no such thing as governance without rulers. If there is no government to enforce - or at least oblige following - laws, there are no laws.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.11.2018 21:51;0;0;I certainly didn't think Clinton would win. (I was expecting a mass exodus to third-party candidates.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2018 21:50;0;0;Monarchy without imperialism. Perhaps define the borders in the Constitution, forbidding the monarch from changing them under any circumstances?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2018 21:48;0;5;Yemen is not the US's responsibility. Starvation outside our borders is NOT the US government's job. That's when taxation really does become theft. When voting, focus on the US government and its duties. When looking at foreign problems, look to solve it through private charity.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2018 21:44;0;0;If a third party couldn't even come close to winning in 2016, with the mainstream candidates being Clinton and Trump, they will NEVER win (unless serious voting reform is done first). \;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.11.2018 21:39;0;1;I think [small] monarchy is fairly well-proven to be the best system in both theory and practice.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2018 21:38;1;3;Quite often, there is a HUGE difference in number of people each candidate advocates murdering. True, it doesn't justify murdering the fewer number, but it does justify us voting against the larger number.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2018 21:35;3;46;Disclaimer: I do not endorse democracy or voting in general, but so long as that is the status quo, we should do our part to try to ensure the least-bad outcome.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2018 21:35;0;4;* A minority of candidates made it impractical to find out their positions on key topics. Since I couldn't make an informed decision on these offices, I extrapolated from the all-Republican results of the ones I could.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2018 21:35;7;56;I'm voting an all-Republican ballot this year. Not because I like Republicans, but because I actually looked at all the candidates, and the Democrat candidates are* much worse. Your candidates are different than mine.

LukeDashjr;6.11.2018 05:22;0;1;You underestimate evil. Especially the evil of pride, which is a fundamental underpinning of the shift to democracy. Also, the entire world did not voluntarily shift - at least parts of it were forced.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.11.2018 03:09;0;0;Also, it's pretty official. Bishop Thuc formally declared JP2 to not be a pope. All the Catholic bishops today also condemn the V2 sect, including their antipopes, outright. It literally can't get any more official than that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2018 03:08;0;0;What we know for sure is that a heretic cannot be pope, and that no formal declaration is necessary (Pp. Paul IV, Cum Ex Apostolatus Officio). Even if it wasn't officially declared, the Catholic Faith still obliges us to recognise and act on the facts.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 19:18;0;0;Here's a good summary by Bishop Sanborn: http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/SSPX_QA_RevPDF2.pdf … Maybe he can explain it to you better.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 19:17;0;1;No, according to the Catholic Church's definition of what it means to be a pope, they are not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 19:12;0;0;I never said there are no valid bishops or priests. There are many.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 19:12;0;0;Political power is the only thing Paul VI or Francis have. For some reason you seem to think this makes them popes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 18:46;0;0;Real world events are not a decision to be made. They are objective truth. Anyone can observe objective truth.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 18:45;0;1;God has not abandoned the Church, merely deprived us of political power and allowed yet another false religion to come to power instead. He never promised power to us, just sound doctrine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 18:44;0;0;If you are obedient to the teaching authority of the Church, then why are you IGNORING the Church's teaching on this circumstance?

Paul IV, Cum Ex A.O.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 18:33;0;0;Yet Catholic theologians have predicted such events for centuries before it finally happened...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 18:31;0;0;The Church defined that heretics cannot be popes. You are the one declaring Paul VI a pope against the Church's teaching.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 18:31;0;0;Martin Luther rejected the Faith. That's what you're doing. I'm merely upholding the Faith, and following what the Church teaches.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 18:30;0;0;Bishops are subjects of popes. They can't judge a superior any more than laity can. Before they can formally judge a heretic, he must be their inferior. That is, he must have *already* lost office. The Church teaches that no declaration is needed for the loss of office itself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 18:27;0;0;You are the one who is choosing to reject the Faith. By what authority do you declare Paul VI a pope, when the Church has defined that he cannot be?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 18:26;0;0;He never made a covenant that the papacy would not go vacant for decades. The Church never taught such a thing either. What He did promise was that His Church would never teach heresy, and His Church did define that a heretic cannot hold the office.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 18:24;0;0;I deny nothing of the Faith. That's you. Nor do I reject the Church's authority. I respect what the Church has defined to be that authority.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 18:17;0;1;I don't loathe *any* popes. Francis is not a pope at all, though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 18:16;0;0;There isn't a *good* reason. Only bad reasons.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 18:16;0;0;Probably helps them find you.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 18:14;0;0;It wasn't filled by an Arian or heretics.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 18:14;0;1;Who are you that you presume to know what God would allow or not? Perhaps He hasn't allowed it - maybe there's a pope I don't know about somewhere. But it is *heresy* to say that a public heretic like Paul VI or Francis could be pope. Your lack of faith does not excuse heresy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 18:11;0;0;They aren't the Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 09:35;0;1;Who knows. Either way, neither of them are Catholics, and it isn't acceptable for Catholics to go to non-Catholics for the Sacraments (even if valid) outside of danger of death, so it's mostly an academic question.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 08:44;0;1;"Nearly all the V2 priests"" today were ""ordained"" by such invalid bishops.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 07:42;0;0;(If they were actually faithful, they would follow the Church's teachings and reject the V2 sect!);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 07:41;0;0;It's no different than the situation with protestants.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 07:40;0;0;There are quite a few Catholic bishops in communion with the Holy See, despite its present vacancy. (Note that during vacancies, bishops may consecrate without the papal mandate, within reason.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 07:24;0;0;Christ never promised unending political power to the Church. He DID promise it would preserve His doctrine faithfully and wouldn't teach heresy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 07:09;0;0;Nonsense. YOU completely reject Christ's promises when you say the Church teaches heresy. I, on the other hand, merely follow the Church's teachings. He hasn't abandoned the Church, just admonished it by taking away political power.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 07:00;0;1;Catholic doctrine teaches that heretics like Paul VI cannot be a pope under any circumstances, even with the unanimous support of the cardinals, and even if no formal declaration of heresy has been made. To say Paul VI was a pope, is heretical.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 06:57;0;0;The Church isn't defeated nor dying out. All Catholic bishops ordain only in the pre-V2 rite.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 06:47;0;0;1) The Novus Ordo was not promulgated by any pope. 2) My main point is the ordinations of their ministers is invalid. They cannot say a valid Mass in ANY form.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 06:40;0;0;I'm just repeating what the Church teaches...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 05:51;0;0;Also, even in the rare case it might be valid (eg, a very old priest ordained validly), it is always still a sacrilege (like the Black Mass) and illicit. I'm not 100% sure, but I suspect it would not be wrong to interrupt such things. Not the same as interrupting a Catholic Mass;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 05:49;0;0;No, I am spouting Catholic teaching. While the current form of the Novus Ordo may be technically valid, that is always conditional on a validly ordained priest being the minister. But V2 clergy are NOT validly ordained, thus they cannot validly say ANY Mass.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 05:28;0;14;Once upon a time, bitcoin merchants used to pass on their fee and fraud savings to bitcoin customers in the form of discounts.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 05:09;0;2;Why even peddle their slander?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 05:07;0;0;There is no consecration in Modernist churches. They have almost no valid priests anymore. It is 100% offensive to God.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 03:58;2;9;Also, for the customer, chargebacks are a valuable fraud prevention mechanism. There are many scammy companies out there...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 03:58;1;11;Cost is actually negative for VISA in practice (w/ cash back cards), to the customer. Yes, merchants pass on the fees to the customer, but most merchants today who accept Bitcoin DON'T give discounts for paying in bitcoins (ie, the VISA fee is still paid);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 03:18;0;1;My point is that democracy is fundamentally flawed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2018 03:00;0;0;"Specifically, this pretty clearly contradicts Christianity: ...God has granted each person to be the steward of himself and none other...""

LukeDashjr;3.11.2018 20:45;0;0;AFAIK, there is no auditing possible that can detect backdoors, but @ IBMPowerSystems at least claims they don't have such backdoors, and there is no evidence I'm aware of that they are lying (which would be more evident than with x86, given the open source CPU firmware).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.10.2018 21:45;0;0;Even if it doesn't, I don't think we can say not voting is a sin, since people do not (AFAIK) have any moral obligation to be part of the government.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.10.2018 21:44;1;2;Catholicism holds that all governments are morally obliged to recognise Christ and His Church. Thus these clauses would seem to be themselves a sinful act (not merely professing a heresy, but actually sinning by the very declaration).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.10.2018 21:22;0;3;In some cases, voting might actually be immoral. In Florida, if you want to register to vote, you must swear to DEFEND the US Constitution (arguably itself a sin since it defies Christ's Kingship). Can one in good faith defend sin?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.10.2018 14:12;0;0;That does not follow. A standard needs someone to define it, even if everyone voluntarily follows that standard. Additionally, there will always be the exceptional person who chooses to be a criminal, and in those cases, force is needed.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.10.2018 13:56;0;0;Rulers don't define what is good, and while they can issue civil rights, they do not have any authority over fundamental rights.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.10.2018 13:55;0;0;No, control is not necessarily force. A moral society will generally be comprised of people who freely obey.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.10.2018 13:52;0;0;Our responsibility for our actions does not change the fact that we cannot do anything without God allowing it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.10.2018 13:51;0;0;We can act only when God allows us to. Sometimes He stops us by the laws of physics. Other times by denying us the opportunity. And yet other times, by the deterrence of the State. (Not intended to be a comprehensive list.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.10.2018 13:50;0;0;No, I'm not wrong. Government is good. That doesn't mean corruption isn't bad.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.10.2018 21:33;0;0;Kindle is not PDF;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.10.2018 18:41;0;1;Uh, no?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2018 17:09;0;0;It's not arbitrary. Semi-automatic guns are the point where the attacker loses the most advantage over the defender. The attacker does not lose any further advantage by escalation beyond that point, and DOES gain an advantage if the defender has anything less.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2018 17:08;0;1;Bitcoin remains Bitcoin unless the entire community goes along with a change. That is, for <modified Bitcoin> to become Bitcoin, the former Bitcoin needs to be abandoned.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2018 16:21;0;0;You are also wrong. Miners/hashrate does not decide what Bitcoin is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2018 16:20;0;0;Eventually.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2018 16:20;0;1;Except BTC is actually Bitcoin, and BCH is actually NOT Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2018 16:19;0;0;That's false.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2018 16:19;0;0;The right to defend yourself is above any human law. P.S. Not all human legal systems are democracies. Democracy is actually one of the worst forms of government.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.10.2018 00:11;1;11;While your argument is sound, this is a centralisation pressure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 23:58;0;0;You're STILL missing the point. What happens if you're confronted by someone WITHOUT a gun? In that scenario, too, you're defenseless unless YOU have a gun.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 23:49;0;0;"No, you are missing the point. Criminals don't need guns to rob you. But guns are your only realistic hope of defending yourself, regardless of the criminal's weapon (or lack thereof). Gun crime"" is a distraction.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 22:07;0;0;Never said anything is 100% safe or less risky. The point is that you have a right to try to defend yourself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 20:50;0;0;"2x $2k = $4k ;) But you're right, perhaps two separate machines is better than a single with two CPUs. Better isolation.";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 19:31;0;0;That doesn't change the fact that people still have the right to do so.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 18:57;0;1;(Note that poorly educated siblings are going to have the same problems when they get their own guns. One can only hope the 7 year difference might help simply from natural maturity.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 18:56;0;1;I don't agree the gun management was irresponsible. Only the education.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 18:55;0;1;This is nothing but speculative propaganda. And again, even if it were true, it DOESN'T MATTER.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 18:45;0;1;The US is a big place, and includes lots of anti-gun cities and schools. At the very least, exclude those regions if you want to try to make a point. Regardless, rights are not contingent on any given outcome to such statistics, nor even if it was shown to be causal.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 18:29;0;0;Driving is a privilege, not a right. The 11 year old was jailed for his crime.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 18:24;0;1;Okay, I guess that punishment makes sense then. (But the problem here is lack of self-control and common sense, not access to a gun.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 18:22;0;0;How parents raise their children is likewise outside the jurisdiction of governments. If they're your neighbours, all the more reason for you and your children to be armed in case they try something stupid. Or move if you're really worried.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 18:20;0;1;"Could just give out the free"" gun at completion of high school or the equivalent gun safety course. (Note I'm not saying making the right to defend oneself conditional on gun safety course, only the ""free"" handgun)""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 18:13;0;0;Was it premeditated? Did he even intend to do it?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 18:12;0;0;That's a failure in education. Hopefully the parents have learned to teach the other children gun safety and when it's acceptable to wield one.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 18:11;0;1;Guns need to be accessible and loaded (or quickly loaded) in the event of a home invasion. Perhaps there are ways to improve on safety (lock the shotgun up during the day?), but sometimes accidents are actually unavoidable. An 11 year old should have known better, though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 18:06;0;1;"Better guns will always cost more. But I do support providing a free"" handgun to each adult citizen, and perhaps it would make sense to require it be the same model issued to police?""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 18:03;0;6;Ad hominems are not arguments. Patreon isn't handouts.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 18:02;0;1;I've never had to use my gun in the USA either. But having it ensures if I ever do need it, I'm not left defenseless. There is no place in the world (where people live) with zero crime. The only place in the world with zero murders, is the rare city that REQUIRES gun ownership.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 18:00;0;1;Yes, criminals give up their rights when they commit a crime. (Although might be a bit extreme to treat an 11 year old this way...) Stupid people, on the other hand, have rights too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 17:59;0;0;Any and all attempts to do so are an abuse of power, not a legitimate/just exercise of authority.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 17:59;0;0;Well, they have an obligation, but it's quite plausible they won't fulfil it, and even if they want to, doing so literally means cops at every back alley 24/7, or at least following every person around. (And an absence of corrupt cops!);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 17:56;0;3;Even government employees have a right to defend themselves while on duty.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 17:56;0;0;No, they don't. Even there, people have a right to own and carry guns.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 17:54;0;0;"Non-practice of your rights doesn't mean you don't have those rights. Not observing crime in your personal experience doesn't mean crime doesn't happen. There is no rational basis to single-out being shot"" as a specific crime distinct from others.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 17:53;0;0;Governments cannot protect you from every possible assault, and the statistics clearly show that claim is bunk. Crime DOES happen almost everywhere. The only places with a ZERO incidence of certain crimes (eg, homicide) are the rare places where gun ownership is mandatory.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 17:52;0;0;It would be totally legal to own and carry a gun in the UK, even if nobody does it or the government abuses its power to make it difficult or impractical. In justice, the people have a right to do so still.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 17:51;0;0;"Yes, but that's proving Catholicism is true"", not ""proving the V2 sect is false"" Proving Catholicism, especially from scratch, is a lot more work (certainly way too much for Twitter) than disproving most false religions.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 17:49;0;0;What guns do you have, if not semi-automatic? You manually load each round? That isn't going to be very useful for defense...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 17:48;0;0;In addition to gun safety, teach obvious things like self control. We're not mere beasts who can't control their actions. We're rational human beings who can second-guess our emotions and choose NOT to do stupid things.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 17:47;0;0;Again, these are social problems. not space problems. It certainly doesn't justify abuses like IVF.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 17:45;0;0;Criminals have an advantage without guns. If you're chosen as the victim, you're at a significant disadvantage.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 17:44;0;0;Of course. Christians aren't irrational / anti-gun.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 17:44;0;0;There isn't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 17:43;0;0;No. Perhaps insane people might be less deadly, but the criminals will just use another tool, or even bare hands.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 17:42;0;0;Logic leads to the conclusion that Catholicism is true.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 04:42;0;0;Perhaps more importantly, non-medication treatment is generally far more effective than medication-based treatment, and even when medication is used, relapse risk is reduced by discontinuing the medication when it is no longer needed. So usually better to avoid entirely.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 04:40;0;0;Psychiatric medication is brute force - nobody, not even psychiatrists, really knows how they work or what mental side effects they will have. What we do know, is based on the self-reports of patients, who are obviously mentally compromised.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 04:21;0;0;Psychiatry is not an exact science, at least today. They certainly shouldn't be included. It's not a matter of law, so there's no reason to include lawyers or policy analysists. Psychology seems to have established some credibility, but includes a lot of subjectivism as well.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 04:18;0;1;"Locking up the mentally ill and denying them their rights is arguably wrong, but there's also an argument to be made that their usage"" of their rights might not really be themselves acting. A bigger problem here is who gets to judge what is mental illness or not.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 04:17;0;0;Generally, criminals give up their rights when they choose to commit the crime. Due process is *supposed* to prevent violating the rights of people who actually still have them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 04:06;0;0;Against the assailant who has chosen who to try to victimise.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 04:05;0;0;God gave us the capacity to use logic for a reason...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 03:50;0;0;Unless you have literally zero crime, there's no basis to say guns aren't needed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 03:47;0;0;Struggle? Not really. Just don't have citations for them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 03:47;0;0;It gets worse: most people don't even practice the religion they profess to be.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 03:45;0;1;That's social issues (and pretty funny they act all confused about it!) not space issues.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 03:36;0;0;False gods do not exist. Non-existent things don't grant authority.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 03:32;0;4;Is there a problem with sex?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 03:28;0;0;Yes;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 03:26;0;1;I'm not sure machine guns have the same properties (giving the defender an equal advantage) as regular semi-automatics. Not having given *too much* thought to it, I'd speculate banning/regulating those is fair game.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 03:25;0;0;The real God, Whom I choose to acknowledge, worship, and (at least strive to) obey.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 03:16;0;0;No, it comes from the God who exists and defines reality as we know it in general. I don't know where the doctrines relating to human rights are formally defined. Francis is not a pope of Catholics.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 03:11;0;0;Also, due to corrupt politicians and judges who do not recognise divine law, the Constitution needs to mirror the natural rights explicitly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 03:11;0;1;I didn't say that. The Constitution exists to define and limit the federal government's authority, granted to it by the individual States (which themselves receive authority from God).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 03:06;0;1;Governments have no authority except what they are granted from above (God).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 03:05;0;2;That is not correct. Rights are given to us by God, in the form of obligations. Legitimate authority is also given by God, and limited in scope. Men have no authority to repeal God-given rights. (Not to be confused with mere civil rights like freedom of speech.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 03:01;0;0;"Making reference to gun violence"" is an inherently dishonest statistic, since non-gun violence is no better.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 03:01;0;2;Your arguments don't hold up. Critical thought is more than just a single knee-jerk response. You need to think it through.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 02:59;0;5;Rights are derived from obligations. We have a right to try to defend ourselves inevitably because we have obligations toward God, and cannot fulfil those obligations if we are dead, maimed, or lose the resources God has provided them for that purpose.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 02:57;0;0;At the end of the day, no amount of research will ever change the fact that self-defense is a right. Even if the statistics and logic actually favoured your position (which they don't, or you wouldn't need to cite dishonest statistics), it would still be a right to have a gun.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 02:52;0;3;Driving is a privilege. Self-defense is a right. Totally agree that schools should be required to teach gun safety again, though. It's ridiculous they ever stopped.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 02:52;0;0;You like to assert things with no basis. That's what's irrational.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 02:50;1;1;"That's your problem, not mine. Today"" was simply based on the opportunity to retweet. Was there some particular ""gun violence"" recently? P.S. Ask yourself: Why does ""gun violence"" even matter? Violence is violence regardless of tool used. It also happens DAILY.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 02:48;0;0;You're claiming statistics that are actually irrelevant. Even if those claims stats were true, you overlook the reality that if guns weren't available, those crimes would still be committed with a different tool instead. The only time it matters what the tool is, is for defense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 02:46;1;4;Laws are only real, valid laws, when they are within the government's authority to decree. Governments do not have authority to abrogate natural rights.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 02:45;0;5;You're misrepresenting my statement. I didn't say guns are natural. I said the right to self-defense is natural (which it is). Guns merely enable that right.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 02:44;0;2;These objective statements about invalidity are true, regardless of my own personal positions. Just because you might erroneously disagree doesn't make them become valid.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 02:43;0;0;That's a pretty irrational belief. Criminals don't need guns - they choose their victims, and can just choose people they can overpower with brute force. Guns only help the innocent by giving us a fair shot at protecting ourselves.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 02:36;0;5;If Twitter didn't allow it, he might have been able to remain hidden, or perhaps even succeeded. (Assuming the secret service is competent enough to watch for threats on Twitter.) What good is there in hiding such thing?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 00:14;0;0;Nothing happens without God allowing it to happen. If Jesus is God, He would not allow His doctrine to be completely concealed in this way.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2018 00:07;0;1;If you call Francis your pope, this IS YOUR CHURCH.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 23:52;0;0;Sure, but it's only a $2 mistake if the Lightning wallet is in a different context.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 23:51;0;0;Thus, if the Catholic Church is not infallible, then all religions which claim Jesus to be God must necessarily also be false.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 23:51;0;0;If that were the case, then we would need to reject Jesus's claim of divinity altogether, as the Catholic Church was literally His only legacy for learning His doctrine, and that Church has always upheld that He promised His Church would survive until the end of time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 23:50;0;0;If the Catholic Church is infallible, then all other religions are false religions.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 23:49;0;0;The V2 sect's entire claim to legitimacy is based on its claim to be the Catholic Church. So by proving it is a different religion, we can conclude it is false. Even if the V2 sect does not assert the claim of infallibility, that alone proves it is a different religion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 23:48;0;0;Infallibility is a claim the Catholic Church has always made. So you're combining two different questions here: How do we know the Church is correct? and How do we know the V2 sect is false?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 06:31;0;0;Sounds delusional. God would never endorse Francis, that's for sure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 06:25;0;0;Except the rules for a pope predate Francis and his sect by a long long time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 06:24;0;0;I'm Catholic. You are the one following some other religion.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:50;0;0;No, that is false. Objectively, Francis cannot be a pope.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:50;0;0;Heresy is the denial of Catholic doctrine. Calling Michael a pope is an error, but not a heresy. Calling Francis a pope is heretical, since that contradicts Catholic doctrine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:49;0;0;Obviously I recognise all the real popes, from St. Peter through Pope Pius XII. Every one of them met the Church's definition of a pope, and not a single one of them publicly taught contrary to Catholic doctrine.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:44;0;0;There is currently no person alive who seems to meet the Church's criteria for a pope (but neither do I assert that there certainly isn't a pope).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:43;0;0;Wikipedia's editors are anti-Catholic and do not allow corrections on such matters.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:37;0;0;No sacred texts teach us anything in favour of heretic antipopes like Francis.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:36;0;0;You don't sound very Catholic, I agree. Especially considering that you consider Wikipedia infallible and more authoritative than the Catholic Church's own doctrines.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:34;0;0;Yes, the straight and narrow path that is the Catholic Faith. Nothing sinful about that - it's what God expects of us.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:33;0;0;The only lies here, are coming from you.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:31;0;0;I'm not spreading any lies or misconceptions, just stating Catholic doctrine and objective facts. I'm also not part of any sect - just the Catholic Church that Jesus established.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:30;0;0;No, according to Catholicism and Catholics, he is NOT a pope. He was NOT chosen. Benedict also was never a pope. The people who support Francis are the same people who generally reject Catholic doctrine altogether - most of them even support artificial birth control!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:27;0;0;Except our priests teach the Catholic Faith in its entirety and nothing contrary to it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:26;0;0;No, our priests are not claiming to be popes. Neither are our bishops. Francis is making such a claim, and that is heresy, not simply because of the claim, but because he is a public heretic too. He has ZERO legitimacy, according to Catholic doctrine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:24;0;1;"As for the Bible, what it says about Francis is, But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema."" (Gal 1:8)""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:23;0;1;I'm not the one picking and choosing doctrines - that's you. According to Catholic doctrine, Francis is literally, objectively and verifiably NOT in any position of authority in the Church. The Church is not a democracy. Majority vs minority is irrelevant.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:18;0;1;Nope. According to Catholic doctrine, which all Catholics are bound to believe, Francis *cannot* possibly be pope, since he is a public heretic and therefore outside the Church. The Church has made it clear that this holds even if the person has unanimous support of the cardinals;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:09;0;0;Francis is not even a member of the Catholic Church, much less at the top of it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:07;0;0;Never claimed I did. Nobody has authority to depose a pope.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 05:02;0;1;It is heresy to say doctrine can evolve. God has nothing to do with Francis's sect.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 04:34;0;3;He's right though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 04:32;0;0;Looks like one of Francis's precursors.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2018 04:07;0;3;The Catholic Church is the early Church, but the sect led by antipope Francis certainly is not. Not only is it full of and promotes immorality, it teaches blatant heresy condemned by the real Church.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.10.2018 18:24;0;0;Very unlikely it's even 1% of men. At most 0.000048% of people commit murder, so I'd say the rapist number is somewhere closer to 0.0001% at most (excluding statutory rape, which probably inflates the number a bit).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.10.2018 17:05;0;0;Stats are not in favour of that. Even IF 1 in 6 women is raped, it does not mean 1 in 6 men are rapists. Most likely the very rare rapist has many victims.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2018 17:03;0;1;I guess it depends on how many rapes on average occur before the rapists are caught. Promoting women carrying # guns seems like a good way to reduce the victim numbers.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2018 16:58;0;0;Relevant semantics. There's a huge difference between begging (in which case, you're asking for something for nothing and people might be justified in looking at your financials) and getting paid for actual work you're doing.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.10.2018 13:21;0;0;Technology improves. If we reduce the block size, we can get the growing cost to below the rate of improvement.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2018 13:18;0;0;I don't necessarily disagree, but unlike development, the entire purpose of mining is the competition.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2018 05:58;0;0;For another example, many people make a distinction between allowing an outcome (such as not preventing natural death) and being the *cause* of the same outcome (such as the rare death caused by a vaccine).

LukeDashjr;26.10.2018 05:58;0;1;Not everyone agrees with such tradeoffs.

LukeDashjr;26.10.2018 03:59;0;2;Interfering with miners might have some hiccups, but would be basically successful. Interfering with development might stop progress at worst, but couldn't censor the existing network.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2018 03:52;0;1;Developers have no control over anything, so that's not a factor at least. With mining as centralised as it is, however, one could legitimately call Bitcoin's censorship-resistance claim into question.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.10.2018 23:23;0;0;And no, Segwit doesn't encourage mining w/o validation. That's nonsense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.10.2018 23:23;0;1;Invalid blocks that are rejected, pay nothing of value to miners. If Bitcoin users switched to BCH, then Bitcoin would die, and BCash would become popular.

LukeDashjr;25.10.2018 17:56;0;0;It does. Maybe you should read up on Bitmain's anticompetitive tactics.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.10.2018 17:56;0;0;Expanding does not make mining more profitable. It just multiplies the situation. So at a loss, expansion makes the loss greater.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.10.2018 17:53;0;1;Yes, multiple times.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.10.2018 17:52;0;0;The economy is made up of multiple individuals, obviously. You just trolling now?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.10.2018 17:49;0;0;I did start mining in 2011. I stopped mining when it was too much of a loss to continue, due to anticompetitive miners like Bitmain pushing home miners out. Given the opportunity to even break-even again, I would go back to mining.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.10.2018 17:47;0;0;Uh, the economy rejects invalid blocks BY DEFAULT simply by running a full node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.10.2018 17:47;0;1;So? The world is only about 8 billion people total. If they each need to open/close a channel every few months, that's only 90 million per day.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.10.2018 17:41;0;1;The only thing stopping them from mining is that others are already mining. If those miners go away, everyone can mine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.10.2018 17:41;0;1;Why would 1-7 billion channels open/close each day? That's absurd.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.10.2018 17:39;0;0;But it didn't undo the need of essential ingredients that came before it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.10.2018 17:38;0;2;If users try to onboard too fast, they'll need to wait. Unlikely we'll ever have people try to onboard that fast, though. And with other advances (eg, schnorr), the scaling can improve further.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.10.2018 17:32;0;0;In the specific case of the inflation bug, out of band notification / oral communication is also probably sufficient so long as it is sufficiently quick.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.10.2018 17:31;0;0;For Bitcoin to actually work as designed, the economy needs to generally and firmly reject invalid blocks. Running a full node is currently the only reliable way to automate that. 85% of economic activity using their own full node is probably sufficient.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.10.2018 17:29;0;0;Measurability is not a factor in relevance. PoW is not relevant, no matter how much easier it is to measure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.10.2018 17:28;0;3;If everyone can't run their own node, then we might as well just go back to PayPal, since that's the same thing you'll end up with. Everyone running their own node is what makes Bitcoin different.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.10.2018 17:16;0;1;1) Just because nobody is attacking does not mean Bitcoin is actually working as designed. 2) CVE-2018-17144 is public knowledge, so the stage is set for a strong defensive reaction to any miner exploiting it.

LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 21:14;0;32;Dunno why Bitcoin conferences reject your talks, but it's no surprise altcoins would try to legitimise themselves by using our names...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 19:36;0;1;Please try to learn at least the fundamentals of a topic (in this case natural law) before making a fool of yourself with stupid comments like this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 16:26;0;1;He's wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 16:25;0;1;If two parents cannot conceive in the order of nature, then it is God's will that they should not have (non-adopted) children.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 15:49;0;1;"Point is that you're working with a non-standard definition of natural law"".""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 15:27;0;0;By your argument, even mass murder does not go against natural law and should be legal...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 15:26;0;1;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09076a.htm …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 12:39;0;1;It goes against the natural law, not just Catholic church laws.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 12:37;0;3;Is there any scientific research to prove (or at least come close to proving) that a frozen zygote (or older children/adults) can resume life upon thawing? Regardless, even if they remained alive, the violation of the nature of procreation is still gravely immoral.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 09:32;0;1;I got a nice, low-mileage Ford E350 for about $22k... Most I'd be willing to pay (and for a new vehicle only) is in the $4xk range, only then only if the benefits were very convincing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 03:59;1;3;Yes, bcash is already full of irrational people. You might fit in with them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 03:58;0;2;Both are gravely immoral. Arguably IVF is the worse of the two, since it goes against the very nature of procreation, and generally entails murdering other zygotes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 03:32;1;5;I'm part of the Catholic Church, as established by Jesus and taught by the popes from St. Peter through Pope Pius XII and their hierarchies. You're the one who has chosen error, going against those teachings, thinking you know better than God and His Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 03:30;0;1;Rape and IVF are essentially the same thing, morally speaking.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 02:29;0;2;Not without changing the security model.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 02:29;0;2;"As a faithful Catholic, I am subject and obedient to all the popes. Pope"" Francis, however, is NOT a pope at all, according to Catholic teaching.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 02:28;0;1;We're not schismatics, though. That's your error. Protestants deny the Faith, like you, not like us.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 02:11;0;3;On the contrary, popes are *by definition* Catholics, since non-Catholics cannot hold the office.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 02:10;0;0;"You don't know what you're talking about. Sedevacantists"" are faithful Catholics following Church teaching, nothing more or less.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 02:09;0;0;No human being can come into existence except the active participation of God. The innocence of the child, however, doesn't make things like rape or IVF okay.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 02:09;0;1;Not running a full node is supporting any and all hardforks. ie, with centralised currencies, the userbase has no choice.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 01:17;0;0;It can destroy any altcoins too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 01:17;0;0;That's a symptom of adoption level differences.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 01:14;0;1;Same is (or can be suddenly, in the case of KYC) true of centralised altcoins.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 01:13;0;0;There is no guarantee of a fixed supply in centralised currencies.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 01:12;0;0;I don't see a reason a group of capitalist corporations is more trustworthy issuing a fiat currency, than a government that at least in principle aims to serve the good of some people.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 01:10;0;0;It's more efficient, and its limitations are well-known.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 01:08;0;0;It doesn't have to be.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 01:08;0;0;Better for them to just use national fiat currencies.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 01:07;0;0;Unless China is actively trying to kill Bitcoin (in which case, they would likely succeed), it is probable that Bitmain's miners would end up in others' hands and mining Bitcoin again soon thereafter. But yes, Bitcoin can adapt to loss of hashpower fairly well.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 01:06;0;1;I'm not sure centralised digital currencies can really be considered cryptocurrencies. (PayPal is better than centralised altcoins.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 01:05;0;0;Bitcoin itself only works if most people accepting bitcoins as payment run their own full node. So it's better if they don't use bitcoins at all, if they cannot run a full node. (There may be some level of tolerance for minorities not using full nodes.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 01:03;0;0;That would be excellent for Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 00:54;0;0;Alts don't have the community of developers contributing to Bitcoin's antifragility.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 00:40;0;2;Every single Bitcoin-based altcoin, without ANY exception I know of, depends on SHA256 for security. Even if they change to a non-SHA256 PoW.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 00:34;0;0;Or you can use logic/reason to confirm for yourself that God exists and Catholicism is truth. Playing word games by trying to redefine brainwashing is a dumb waste of time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 00:28;0;4;Spoken like a true victim of brainwashing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 00:27;0;0;How will someone who can't afford a $1 fee, be able to afford the $30+ for a full node?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 00:24;0;0;IVF is gravely immoral and should be made illegal.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 00:22;0;6;It's a better wallet than http://blockchain.info , at least...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 00:09;0;10;"@ EmmanuelMacron Actually being educated also entails accepting that number of children is not our decision to make, but rather that the decision belongs to God. (Unless by educated"" you mean ""brainwashed into liberalism"", in which case, who cares?)""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.10.2018 00:06;0;2;That's not what these actually say...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.10.2018 23:56;1;35;What? Any State-level attack on Bitcoin will be even more effective on alts.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.10.2018 23:53;0;2;So PayPal? Why wouldn't you just use Lightning?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.10.2018 11:17;0;0;1) Install it. 2) Use it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.10.2018 11:17;0;1;Better to keep your wallet at home, and remotely access petty cash from your phone.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.10.2018 10:27;0;0;It's stupid to keep your wallet on your phone. Phones get stolen.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.10.2018 10:26;0;1;It's already pretty turnkey if you use the built-in wallet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.10.2018 10:26;1;1;"When are you going to observe Catholic teaching and admit these heretics are not the Church? if...any Bishop...has deviated from the Catholic Faith...the promotion...shall be null, void and worthless"" -Pope Paul IV, Cum Ex Apostolatus Officio""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.10.2018 10:21;0;0;It's not free, but sharply discounts each child (reaching a maximum of around $10k total excluding book fees):https://www.qasonline.org/;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.10.2018 10:18;0;0;It was always a parody. The Church teaches that heretics cannot be popes, even if they have unanimous support from the cardinals (Pope Paul IV, Cum Ex Apostolatus Officio). Faithful Catholics should reject Francis's claim to the papacy, as he is nothing but a fraud.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.10.2018 09:53;0;1;Shoo troll.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.10.2018 08:03;0;1;Hint: It's okay to be skeptical of Bitcoin's *future* (even I am, to an extent), but to deny the reality that it is working today is just idiocy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.10.2018 07:55;0;0;Tell me, what other clear and present realities are you skeptical of?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.10.2018 07:36;0;0;Ah, nocoiners, gotta love em. No notion that Bitcoin might already be a real thing.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 19:21;0;1;Bitcoin hopefully;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 19:10;0;2;It's not clear to me what you're asking?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 18:57;0;0;Catholicism does not have anything where 50% heresy is better than 90% heresy. Either one is Catholic, or one is a heretic. Denying 5 doctrines is no better than denying 20.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 14:25;1;1;Only businesses run the functionaries. AIUI, anyone can run a node and transact.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 14:02;0;1;Companies don't have families. I assume they're also spread out over different jurisdictions.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 12:58;0;1;The same functionaries that manage the multisig keys also take turns creating blocks, which the group then signs. Nodes verify the signatures on blocks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 12:56;0;0;You're the one embracing ignorance...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 11:48;0;1;Pretty sure that will have the opposite effect.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 10:07;0;0;Yawn. You're just repeating your own fantasies now. The one who needs to educate himself on Church teaching here is you.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 09:42;0;1;You just continue to expose your own ignorance. Warnings can only come from an authority in the Church, ie your pastor. Furthermore, the warning needs to be explicit about what doctrine is being denied. You have not even identified a single doctrine you accuse me of denying.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 09:40;0;2;You're the one who is going against the Church's teachings, not I. It is because I have educated myself, that I have come to the correct understanding which you reject.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 09:02;0;0;"Liquid, on the other hand, can lose bitcoins if compromised, *even if the compromise is known quickly*. Quite a big difference between must be compromised in secret"" and ""can be found out and still succeed"".""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 09:01;0;0;It's not too late to exploit CVE-2018-17144. But if you do it now, you're sure to get noticed immediately, and the reaction would no doubt be to reject your chain as invalid. The only way you could have gotten away with it, was in secret before anyone noticed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 08:58;0;0;No actual pope has ever done so. The Church has defined that a heretic cannot become pope, which is why the V2 antipopes never were in the first place.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 08:56;0;0;Benedict XVI was also an antipope to any clearheaded true Catholic.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 08:53;0;3;I didn't mark Trump on my ballot because of nationalism, racism, or misogyny. I marked him on my ballot because the alternative was Clinton.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 08:53;0;16;Sounds like FUD to me. The only reason the Republicans are in power, is because the Democrats keep nominating people who are even worse. (And the broken election system where only 2 candidates are really eligible.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 08:48;0;0;Prohibition of real-world casinos has worked pretty well afaict... they only exist where explicitly allowed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 08:41;0;0;Bitcoin has a diversity of systems running it, even if not the implementation itself. Also, although the recent CVE-2018-17144 could come close had it been exploited unknown, the loss of sidechain funds on the mainchain would have a permanent effect even if discovered quickly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 06:16;0;0;Liquid is not merge-mined.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 06:15;0;0;https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1051658185864548358 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 06:07;0;1;No, different purposes. Testnets can be used to test with fake bitcoins. Sidechains are the next step: testing with real bitcoins on the line.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 06:06;0;5;AFAIK it's aimed at providing value to regular traders. I'm not a regular trader, so I don't see any benefit to taking the added risks in doing so.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 05:47;0;0;Testnets can't be used with real funds.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 04:24;0;0;Also, I suspect it would be rather hard for anyone (other than the attacker) to roll back Liquid, since it is designed to make such things difficult (perhaps even impossible, especially if the attacker locks them out).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 04:22;0;3;Not the peg-outs, which means if you roll back the sidechain, it becomes fractional reserve.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 04:20;0;0;Yes, and since Pope Pius XII died, the criteria for a new pope has not yet been met. God alone knows when He will see fit to give us the next pope.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 04:18;1;5;Except they've already decided that miners make the rules for some reason.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 04:17;4;21;"And since functionaries (the machines run by those trusted parties) all run the same hardware/software stack (AFAIK; maybe that's changed?), it is likely that a 0-day affecting one, will affect all.https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1051636666899845120 …";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 04:15;0;0;Very unlikely Paul VI is in Heaven.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 04:13;0;0;Political power does not equate to religious power in the Catholic Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 04:12;0;0;The Church has gone many times without a pope. It doesn't cease to be the Church during those periods.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 04:03;0;0;They are in communion with Catholic Rome (ie, St. Peter and his successors), not pagan Rome (eg, Diocletian, Paul VI, Giuseppe Conte). The top of the Catholic Church is and always will be Jesus Himself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 03:44;0;0;Based on Catholic teaching, the last (at least publicly-known) pope was Pope Pius XII. The only one with any claim to being the hierarchy today, are the priests and bishops who actually teach the Catholic Faith, all of whom condemn Paul VI and Francis.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 03:43;0;3;"Part of the problem is that trolls have been falsely claiming Blockstream prevented a block size increase scaling solution"". Blockstream's marketing this way seems, at least for naive people, to ""confirm"" these accusations.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 03:41;0;0;"1) The Church's criteria is not a simple conclave of cardinals"". It also requires that the candidate first be a Catholic. 2) It is an objective, verifiable fact, that they are heretics";;;;;;https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1051649133042429952;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 03:36;0;10;There might be some legitimate offence with Blockstream marketing Liquid as a scaling solution. Sidechains were never about scaling, just testing new features before introducing them to Bitcoin. (Scaling isn't an impossible application, but has some serious issues.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 03:33;0;0;You're starting with the assumption that these heretics are really popes. But they're actually not, and even if they were, you can't just assume a claim to prove that claim.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 03:27;0;0;I'm not blindly trusting in the first place. I'm simply applying the Church's teachings. You are the one who is ignoring the Church's teachings in favour of blind trust.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 03:23;0;0;No.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 03:23;0;0;That webpage is lying. The Catholic Encylopedia's list ends with Pope St. Pius X;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 02:22;0;0;Is Wikipedia your infallible source of doctrine now, since you've apparently rejected the Church's?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 02:15;0;0;The Church has been pointing out these antipopes for quite some time as well. Regardless, even if the Church were to fail to do so, it does not change Catholic doctrine that no such declaration is *necessary*.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 02:12;0;1;The primacy of Rome also dates back to St. Peter.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 02:11;0;0;One does not need a position of authority to follow Catholic teaching. The Church also teaches that no formal declaration is necessary to reject such a false pope.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 02:11;0;0;Scripture is not the basis of Christianity/Catholicism.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 01:49;0;0;Regarding false ecumenism, the nature of the Church, etc. For example, literally every V2 parish promotes common prayer with Protestants, which the Catholic Church has always condemned as a mortal sin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 01:46;0;0;Protestantism and Orthodoxy are not really Christianity, which are certainly *not* closer to Christ's teachings. Can't get any closer than 100% (Catholicism).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.10.2018 01:44;0;1;Idiot I may be, but heretic I am not. I simply affirm and follow Catholic teaching.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;14.10.2018 19:51;0;1;Pope Paul IV's Cum Ex Apostolatus Officio specifically condemns the notion that a heretic can be pope. The Church has condemned Paul VI and his sect since they were established following the French Revolution.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;8.10.2018 01:34;0;0;It is immoral to disobey a just law. Speed limits are generally just laws. But sometimes they are written to impose a fine rather than forbidding speeding. In those cases, it is only wrong to refuse to pay the fine, not merely to speed.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;8.10.2018 01:04;0;0;And since there is no *right* to possess certain plants, government may make just laws prohibiting such, and disobedience to just laws is immoral.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.09.2018 18:50;0;0;The historical rate of improvement to technology is equivalent to 300k block sizes. Any block size larger than that means DESPITE phones getting faster, they will take longer to sync the blockchain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.09.2018 18:49;0;1;Sidechains cannot be more secure than the parent chain. The only way it can help in this case, is if the base chain block size is reduced, and a sidechain has the larger blocks. Technology gets more powerful, SLOWER than even 1 MB blocks grow the chain.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.09.2018 18:26;0;1;Dedicated servers are more than sufficient to store and distribute the full chain. The problem is processing it, which every full node must do once, even if they don't store it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 05:27;0;0;Adoption doesn't matter unless it's adoption using full nodes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 05:19;0;2;[Nearly] everyone needs to run their own full node, or Bitcoin just plain doesn't work.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 04:18;0;8;You're missing the fact that Bitcoin's security model is more than just trusting miners.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 03:51;0;3;Mine a block with your two spends. Keep mining blocks so that your chain is always the most work. BCH full nodes will reject your chain as invalid, but it's unlikely your car sellers are running one.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 03:45;1;10;"No, BCH has embraced the current state that Bitcoin considers insecure. For BCH, this insecurity is their day-to-day normal"". Bitcoin users are supposed to run their own full nodes and enforce the rules. We depend on miners only for transaction ordering, not rules.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 03:37;0;1;If you want PayPal, it already exists. Pretending decentralised currency can be done with less cost than it really can be, is just delusional.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 03:36;0;2;BCH proponents are wrong. That's why it's a problem that only 5% have upgraded.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 03:14;0;1;You don't have to.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 03:13;0;2;Depends on what PayPal says. The same situation exists with a centralised Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 02:25;0;4;Nobody said 24/7;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 02:17;0;0;I agree, but it wasn't *tested*.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 02:15;0;0;Perhaps, but not necessarily without a loss before they notice.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 02:12;0;4;Removing trust is basically the only thing Bitcoin specifically does. If you don't want to remove trust, you should probably just use something centralised.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 02:11;0;1;The easiest way is to simply install it and use it for your wallet. Initial sync time gets longer and longer due to too-large blocks, however.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 01:39;0;1;For better or worse, UASF was never really tested.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 01:38;1;37;Because that's how a decentralised currency works. If you don't run a node, you're just trusting someone else. Might as well use PayPal.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 01:17;0;2;Pruning has been working for years. It doesn't address the initial need to sync, however.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 00:56;0;0;That's not a good thing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 00:54;0;0;If they can't even afford an occasional $5 fee, how will they afford a $30 node?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 00:53;0;2;(Assuming Bitcoin even survives to reach that cross-over point, which is less and less likely, the harder it gets.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 00:53;0;2;If the block size remains the same for several decades, we will eventually catch up, and *then* things will start to get easier. But there's a long way to go until we reach that point, and in the meantime things get harder and harder.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.09.2018 00:51;0;2;Historical improvements to tech have only averaged about 17% per year. 300k is ~16% of ~100 GB (an optimistic estimate of the blockchain size we last had a healthy full node ratio).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 22:02;0;1;"Non-listening nodes: yes SPV"": no, since they're intentionally and perpetually vulnerable to all such exploits.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 22:01;1;15;When it's 87% of the network, you should care, because that's 87% that might not accept your bitcoins as payment if they split off.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 21:58;0;0;0.14.2 isn't, you mean 0.14.3. And yes, my charts DO account for backported fixes already.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 21:57;0;17;How about actually making use of the choices you currently have? Bitcoin has at least 4 options for full node software, yet 99% just run Core.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 21:55;4;21;Running a full nodes does NOT get easier over time. It gets harder. To get easier, the average block size would need to be below 300k. The ratio has only been getting worse. About a year ago, we had around 100k nodes. Now, we have less than 80k.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 21:53;0;2;One has a right to defend their own reputation. If Mr. Ver does not wish to be called a scammer and a liar, he should stop scamming and lying.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 21:32;0;3;If I had as much money as Ver, I'd probably have donated more.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 21:24;0;3;You're wrong. Ratio is what matters, not absolute count.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 21:22;0;0;Nope.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 21:22;0;0;That's not what the full disclosure says.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 21:22;1;12;Scammers like to use others' names without permission. Why is this WDMS thing giving him a stage? What you should really be asking, though, is why is he fabricating false quotes?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 21:13;0;0;"However, if the contract says that the borrower owes (say) $5000 if the car is destroyed, and that he is personally on the hook to pay interest on the $5000 if he can’t pay it all at once, then that is usury."" AFAIK, late fees have never been considered usury by the Church.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 21:07;0;0;Question 29 ignores the fact that the Church has taught some interest to be moral, not merely relaxed penalties.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 20:54;0;0;"Corporations are themselves property"" - how so? They might possess property, which can be bought or sold as a whole or even in abstract, but in of themselves, I do not see how corporations are property. (At least if future assets/labor are considered not real.)""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 20:51;0;0;Question 16 seems to contradict Leonard Lessius's De Justitia et Jure, disp. VI, sec. 2. no. 14, which at least implies one may trade his future labor.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 20:45;0;0;It seems to be based on the idea that you can go after the individual to recover the loaned money. But this does not hold in a society where debt can be discharged through bankruptcy, and ignores the risk of death.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 20:36;0;4;Just as with legacy transactions, Lightning is still not secure without using your own full node. But keeping a wallet on your mobile is also a bad idea. What is needed for mobile, is a simple and secure way to run your own full node + wallet at home, with remote mobile access.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 20:33;0;1;Does he (or anyone else of similar orthodoxy) ever discuss what one should do if Joe has money, Fred has a need of such money, but Joe also needs to put his money to work so as to continue providing for his family?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 20:31;0;0;That interpretation doesn't seem to fit with Church teaching. Why should we need to accept less value in return for what was lent? (Keep in mind with modern fiat currencies, the value per unit drops regularly.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 20:22;0;3;IIRC, that wasn't sufficient last time I consciously thought about it. In any case, I don't have much control of the direction of my dreams.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 20:21;0;4;That's already proven to be impossible.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 20:07;0;6;Maybe they're git commits?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 20:01;0;1;There should be quite a few other decent candidates, perhaps even stronger pro-life, that can be nominated instead.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 20:01;0;1;Nah, let them have their way this time. If he gets on, they're just going to use these allegations, no matter how false, to cast doubt on RvW getting overturned. Or worse, he might not overturn RvW at all out of fear of this resurfacing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 19:50;0;0;That doesn't really make sense. To monitor, you want an upgraded node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 19:50;1;3;"It depends also on the reaction when people discover they've accepted such counterfeits"". Do they accept the new blocks? Reject them, rollback and risk loss of all their income during that time period? Accept them, and softfork out the inflation coins?""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 19:48;0;7;1) Yes. For starters, it actually tries. 2) No. 3) It's always possible to sybil, but that wouldn't support a double spend.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 19:35;0;0;I have no reason to think miners specifically are slow for the upgrade.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 19:35;1;3;Yes, but it only matters if you use it for your wallet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 19:34;1;3;How do you distinguish counterfeit from real bitcoins? Perhaps if everyone allows inflation, that is the real Bitcoin... Hard to argue otherwise if enforcement is a niche.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 19:33;0;0;What good is adoption if we just turn into PayPal?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 17:53;0;6;Reducing total usage is a way to increase full node ratio.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 17:51;0;3;https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures … already has such classifications.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 16:25;0;1;Bitnodes is wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 16:24;0;18;The goal is to make light wallets impractical. The problem is that light wallets are used at all, and that an insufficient % of the network uses their own full node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 16:22;0;1;They only count listening nodes (which is not really a relevant number).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 16:22;3;13;http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/security.html?201817144 … Anything showing ~9-10k nodes is only showing listening nodes (ie, with the port forwarded).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 16:21;0;2;I guess if you consider the 2106 thing an issue, then it does indeed require a hardfork to fix. But that's an exceptional case.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 16:17;0;8;I don't have historical charts (although I've been saving historical data for years, so in theory it might be possible to make them if I get time).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 16:15;0;8;Not to this degree.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 16:12;0;7;BCH considers this an *acceptable* and normal situation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 16:12;0;1;Only to a very limited extent. Even 99% of miners should never be able to inflate.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 16:11;2;16;It takes a month for my charts to remove switched-off nodes (because non-24/7 nodes are still nodes). That being said, there has been a disturbing trend of node count dropping in general over the last year or two... We used to have over 100k, now under 80k.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 16:10;0;1;They do matter.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 16:09;0;0;http://coin.dance doesn't even try to be correct.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 16:09;0;4;There was an alternative: the announcement mailing list. Just it seems to have been broken at some point over the last year, and nobody noticed until this incident.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 16:08;0;12;As with all softforks, the network is not secure if we're just trusting miners to enforce the rules. This vulnerability is only an issue that miners could attack in the first place.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 16:03;0;0;What does an anti-open/freedom GPU vendor have to do with OpenPOWER? If I wanted to see garbage promoting their products, I'd follow @ nvidia.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 16:00;9;74;"(OTOH, the inverse is also true: upgrading too fast could mean more people are blindly trusting the developers and not making an active decision. Perhaps rather than trusting miners"", it could be seen as ""choosing to allow double spends / inflation"")""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 15:58;0;1;For better or worse, I need to be awake right now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 15:57;142;406;Ugh, 87% of the # Bitcoin network is *still* vulnerable to CVE-2018-17144. Every day this goes on, we are trusting miner(s) and lose credibility with the decentralised network claim.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 15:49;0;3;A change of valid into invalid is a softfork, by definition. A hardfork would be making something invalid, into something valid. CT = Confidential Transactions;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 15:43;2;6;"(Another practical problem would be that this still can't break trust me, I'm a hosted wallet""-type Bitcoin-banks...)""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 15:43;2;10;A way to handle the valid-but-withheld-data case may also be necessary. I'm not sure these hurdles can be overcome, but just in case someone else knows how, thought I'd put this out here...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 15:43;0;6;Thus, full nodes are required to prove which block is the true one. The problem is, the invalid block variants need to not commit to any transactions on the true chain, and we need the invalid variants to be otherwise indistinguishable except for the one subtle rule violation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 15:43;8;70;So this morning while I was asleep, I almost solved the light wallet problem in my dreams. The idea is to require blocks to commit equally to not only the valid transactions being mined, but also invalid variants of that same block. … # Bitcoin;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 15:37;0;20;Not even close to just one mistake...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 15:36;0;1;I'm pretty confident that there are zero bugs that require a hardfork to fix. Only new features need hardforks.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 05:03;0;0;No, not because of that. Because there really only is one Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 05:02;0;2;Yes. Not to be confused with S[pent]TXOs.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 04:53;0;5;Non-Segwit nodes do in fact track the UTXO conditions. They just don't understand or enforce them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 04:49;0;2;That definition works fine. With an extension block, earlier client versions no longer function. The job of a full node is to maintain the UTXO set. That doesn't happen with an extension block.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 04:40;0;4;They're not unaware of it, only unaware of the conditions. But like I said, that's true of all softforks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 04:34;0;2;They're unaware of CT UTXOs.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 04:29;0;1;Existing nodes continue working 100% with segwit (minus no longer being fully validating, but that's true of all softforks).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 04:27;0;5;No, they're not softforks, because existing nodes will not accept the new blocks (only partial blocks). https://luke.dashjr.org/tmp/code/bitcoin-protocol-changes.png …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 04:22;0;4;That's an extension block, not a softfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 04:22;0;0;Looks more like an extension block than a softfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 04:20;0;1;Blah. No respect for a platform that ignores standards, runs ICOs, and sends email spam.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 04:20;0;1;No, it applies to any CT at all. The UTXO set includes amounts.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 03:42;0;3;CT *inherently* requires a hardfork. I am pretty certain there is no way to do it as a softfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2018 03:39;0;0;CT requires a hardfork, though.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.09.2018 22:39;2;16;What are RGB tokens? This would mean P2SH, Segwit, Confidential Transactions, etc are scams. This would mean merchants who accept Bitcoin are scams. It's just plain absurd.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.09.2018 19:06;0;9;"That assumes CT is necessary for privacy. I don't think that premise holds. Also, it's not coin supply"" as much as it is counterfeiting or double spending, right?

LukeDashjr;22.09.2018 17:07;0;2;I don't think the fix PR met our usual standard of obfuscation. As for the actual full disclosure notice, while it was understandably necessitated by the leak, I don't think we needed to explain how to exploit it so clearly.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.09.2018 15:18;6;54;I'm retracting this.

LukeDashjr;21.09.2018 00:08;0;2;No kidding. We keep outgrowing our churches! The seminary down here is closing the book store to turn it into a cry-room because the main church area is too small for everyone.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2018 00:01;0;0;Except the laws are allowing it, as you pointed out.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 23:47;0;1;But there's a good reason for that. Unjust enslavement and slave abuse were commonplace before the ban. I don't think I've ever seen parents letting their immature children get married, despite some laws permitting it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 23:36;0;2;Makes sense. Modern late marriage is a rather unusual cultural thing historically. If parents raise their children to be mature at 14 (12 might be pushing it), that's fine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 23:28;0;0;Except you're actually disregarding the Church's direction/teaching. But in any case, it's unclear to me after the discussion: do you prefer I not follow you, or re-follow you?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 23:26;0;0;(While perhaps it can be justified for the law to tolerate fornication, it doesn't need to bend over backward to solve problems like this that arise from it.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 23:23;0;3;Kindof, but I can't sympathise. It's fornication either way. If they were getting married, age is certain, and the problem vanishes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 23:20;0;2;There has to be a limit somewhere.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 23:10;0;1;Probably if it was 16 in Texas, they'd have found a 15 year old to play the role.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 23:05;0;2;Age of consent in Texas is 17, so with a 16 year old is statutory rape.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 22:59;0;5;Doing something so controversial (and illegal here, I think?) as going to a prostitute is unambiguously unsafe to say the least IMO.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 22:04;0;0;We don't know if God will give either or both of us another 20 years. In the meantime, I will continue to follow the Church's direction for how I should consider the current reality.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 21:50;0;0;And yes, Catholicism is a top-down monarchical religion, not a democracy. If you want to claim the Vatican is Catholic, it is the Vatican you need to look at.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 21:47;0;0;Honorius was condemned to be counted among the heretics for his failure to condemn them, but he himself never publicly taught the heresy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 21:47;0;0;It's a matter of no formal judgement being needed for loss of office. There is zero precedent specifically for the papacy, since, as the [first] Vatican Council concluded, there has never been a pope that became a heretic.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 21:37;0;1;As if things don't just continually get worse in the V2 sect.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 21:36;0;0;*IF* they cleanse themselves of immorality, the fact remains they are teaching heresy, and thus cannot be the Church if Christ's promise is to hold. If they repent of their heresies and convert to Catholicism, that would necessarily include condemning the V2 antipopes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 21:35;0;0;The Saints have not taught that a council is needed for laity to acknowledge it, only for the canonical effects.

LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 21:31;0;0;Then you should study historical precedents more, and actually read the writings of said Saints... They don't leave *any* room for claiming a heretic can be pope.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 21:30;0;0;Using that definition of formal makes it even less relevant - and even provably irrelevant. A council has no authority to declare a true pope a heretic.

LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 18:41;0;0;While bishops ought to formally declare the fact, it remains a fact even without such a declaration (as taught by Pope Paul IV and others). In any case, Bishop Thuc formally declared the sede vacante under JP2, and the Catholic bishops today have never ceased condemning antipopes;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 18:40;0;0;Material/formal heresy is *not* actually relevant here - the Church's criteria is private vs public heresy. Regardless, the V2 antipopes are both clearly formal heretics and public heretics.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 18:35;0;0;"It is in fact DENIAL of the sede thesis"" that denies Our Lord's promise to the Church.

LukeDashjr;20.09.2018 18:34;0;0;To be Catholic, one must assent to everything the Church teaches on matters of faith and morals.

LukeDashjr;14.09.2018 15:45;0;0;In other words, to make block size proportional to technology changes, we would need to reduce the limit to 300k.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.09.2018 15:45;0;1;Storage space has NEVER been an issue for any of this. Bandwidth and CPU time are. Historically, there has been an average 17% improvement per year. That translates to 300k block sizes on average.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;11.09.2018 03:32;0;0;History doesn't support that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.09.2018 03:31;0;2;Based on Catholic doctrine, I don't see any way to justify the belief that Francis has ever been a pope.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.09.2018 02:46;1;2;No, protestantism is a false religion invented by evil men of the 16th century. It has no history prior to that era.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;11.09.2018 01:28;0;0;That was the conclusion I came to after years of studying various religious claims. Way too much data to go over on Twitter, if I even had the time. Relatively easy to prove all the other religions false, though.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;11.09.2018 01:15;0;2;It really depends on your background. Most people today who thought they grew up Catholic were in fact never even exposed to basic doctrines.

LukeDashjr;11.09.2018 00:46;0;1;At least partly because Catholics are a tiny minority of people on this planet, and very few of us have any power to act on such matters.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.09.2018 00:45;0;0;Society's return to the Catholic Church at least in theory would take care of both these problems.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.09.2018 00:44;0;0;Yes, a PR problem solved by education and admonishing/boycotting the corrupt mass media that spreads lies about it. (And hopefully shutting down the fraudulent pedophile organization the mass media is falsely portraying as the Catholic Church);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;11.09.2018 00:17;0;0;(.14) Jesus often taught in parables, intended to confuse the Pharisees and others of bad will. Similarly, the prophets of the Old Testament were given only partial understanding of the truths later revealed by Christ. Thus, reading the Scripture's account of these is unclear.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.09.2018 00:15;0;0;Final appeal in matters of faith? This is nonsensical. One cannot appeal to mere text, which is not a person able to make judgements. Christ gave the authority to teach and explain doctrine to His Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.09.2018 00:13;0;0;Sole source of revelation? Certainly not. Christ revealed orally, not in writing. The Apostles put some into writing, but most was not committed to text until centuries or even millennia later.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 10:52;0;2;Lack of the rest of the miners making up a significant % would be a pretty good indicator.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 10:40;0;3;(A safe level would be about 85% of users running their own full node. Under 65% or so, I'd say is the high-danger region.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 10:38;0;0;Not for Jihan, who can use their proprietary AsicBoost, doesn't have to pay a sales mark-up, and already has cemented his hashrate majority on the network (ie, difficulty increased already).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 10:36;0;2;We are likely already in a lot of trouble. There's only about 100000 full nodes, and probably magnitudes more using Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 10:35;0;1;Scamcoins *don't* do anything innovative like that, however. Besides, sidechains can do it too, without the scamming.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 10:34;0;1;Since there's no evidence of a mass selloff to other people, that means it's still under Jihan's control one way or another.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 10:34;0;3;Bitmain announced some months back their total hashrate in the name of transparency. Their claim was unbelievably low. Unless they're just outright lying (which wouldn't make sense to lie this low, given their IPO stuff), that indicates they've moved most of their >50% elsewhere.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 10:32;0;1;(The blockchain size is already dangerously far beyond where most people are *willing* to run their own node.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 10:32;0;2;It's not the blocks themselves that matter so much, but rather the blockchain as a whole. With blocks larger than 300k, the blockchain grows faster than technology can keep up with, eventually making it *impossible* to start a new node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 10:28;0;0;Bitmain the legal entity doesn't matter. Notice Jihan already moved all the hashpower off to other legal entities, so he retains control after the IPO.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 10:26;0;1;(But any incentive-based approach like this requires users to care more about decentralisation than low fees, and I'm not sure that's realistic.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 10:23;0;1;Reducing the block size limit, in this context. But yes, PoW change is another example. I've not seen anything to indicate we *don't* need it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 10:22;1;1;Perhaps a softfork to allow transactions to consume extra block weight (without increasing their size, obviously) would help.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 10:18;0;0;Too bad we don't act when problems get found... kinda defeats the point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 10:17;0;3;Pretty much.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 09:57;0;1;Price discovery doesn't work anyway when the people being paid (miners) are different from the people bearing the load (users).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 09:56;0;0;From here, the only way back to sanity is likely a softfork to at least temporarily reduce the max block weight to some sane level. But the community needs to get behind it before any action can be taken.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 09:56;0;0;A long time ago, miners actually cared about the network, and filtered out spam on their own. Then a bunch of n00bs got the idea that spam filtering was evil censorship, blocks had to be unlimited size, and the rest just follows naturally at that point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 09:41;0;0;Estimating cost is complex. Not only do bandwidth/CPU/etc costs vary, but also, for example, how do we factor in loss of network security due to people who don't run nodes?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 09:41;0;0;Spam or not depends on whether the data represents a real transfer from one entity/wallet to another. So SatoshiDice is spam because it's messaging game states rather than actually sending money around.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 09:32;0;7;Education & branding that we *wouldn't* need to do if BCH wasn't there, and doesn't make Bitcoin any better. Lightning is mainly motivated by speed and fees, so doesn't really need Monero's privacy motivations.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.09.2018 09:25;1;4;I'm not sure most fees cover their costs either... But the only time to take it out on miners, is when it's spam (and then, regardless of the fee).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.08.2018 06:04;0;0;To put it simply: God Himself guaranteed it.

LukeDashjr;30.08.2018 06:02;0;0;Premise 3: God guarantees that under certain conditions, He will not allow error to be taught. Conclusion: Under said conditions, regardless of the actors involved, error will not be taught.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.08.2018 06:02;0;0;I can see how one might think that at face value, but it actually doesn't. Premise 1: God has absolute knowledge. Premise 2: God has absolute control over everything that occurs. ...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.08.2018 05:54;0;0;Francis's sect is not the Church. It has no divine guidance whatsoever.

LukeDashjr;30.08.2018 05:43;0;0;The Church has defined the canon of Scripture in the same way it has defined that heretics cannot be popes. It has also defined that only under very specific conditions is even a real pope infallible, as well as the infallibility of the Church clergy teaching collectively.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.08.2018 05:35;0;0;But more importantly: the Church defines the criteria to become pope, NOT some mere smoke. We're Catholics, not pagans.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.08.2018 04:00;0;4;I guess so. Maybe some CPUs use NSA PRNGs? (POWER9 has a true RNG AIUI);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.08.2018 02:18;0;1;That'd be an argument not to have the config option at all, I guess. But most CPU behaviours can be verified externally. The RNG, on the other hand, is inherently non-deterministic and therefore non-verifiable.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.08.2018 20:13;0;0;I didn't say value. I said *cost*. Value is necessarily higher than cost. If it costs someone $50k/year to live where you have them work, the absolute minimum reasonable pay for full time is $50k/year, period.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.08.2018 18:24;0;0;You say that as if money is simply being taken and given away. But the minimum wage is about paying people what is fairly due. They worked for that money - they weren't simply given it. It's not Marxism. It's justice.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.08.2018 18:16;0;0;The real problem here is capitalism, where people are perceived as merely a resource to be exploited at some cost, toward the bottom line of corporate profit. (Note that socialism and communism are just as bad, and I don't support those either.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.08.2018 18:13;0;0;Raising minimum wage isn't about paying more. It's about paying the same. You know the USD suffers from inflation, right? (Although tbh, I'm surprised fast food isn't already automated vending machines as of a decade ago...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.08.2018 18:04;0;0;Paying people less than what it reasonably costs to live (currently higher than minimum wage in many areas) should be illegal, regardless of the outcome. Medicaid should not be abused to subsidize abusive businesses like this.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 06:42;0;0;It is not an abstract idea. It is a concrete organization. Just not the Modernist sect.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 06:42;0;0;Furthermore, the conditions of papal infallibility also include that it must have been held by the Church from the time of the Apostles - not necessarily explicitly, but at least to the extent that the doctrine being defined must follow logically from them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 06:42;0;0;Papal infallibility is only under specific conditions. The most obvious condition is that the person must in fact be a pope, which heretics cannot be (per Catholic teaching too).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 06:34;0;0;The Church in AD 100 and the Church in AD 1950 taught and believed the same doctrines. If there was a problem with recognising, it would be due to the persecution in AD 100, and languages spoken, not a material difference in doctrine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 06:33;0;0;No, Church teaching has never changed. The only thing that councils have done is *clarify* things *already* taught, make assent to those clarifications binding, and/or require explicit profession of them.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 06:07;0;0;No, but you sound like you are. No pedos in the Catholic Church, despite the misrepresentations you've been fed by the lying mainstream media.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 06:06;0;1;Revelation comes from God, and *public* revelation ended with the death of the last Apostle. To know this, we must first use reason to determine the legitimacy of the Catholic Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 06:05;0;0;At the moment, the office is vacant. The principle (and current Code of Canon Law) still stand, though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 06:04;0;1;It is the Church's duty to condemn heresy. However, it does not take such a formal condemnation to recognise heresy for what it is - as a matter of objective truth, anyone can ascertain that. The V2 hierarchy is not the hierarchy Jesus established.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 06:00;0;1;The papacy is currently vacant. Catholic doctrine teaches that heretics cannot hold office under any circumstances.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 06:00;0;1;Yes, modern Orthodox are also heretics, but their schism is what defined them as a separate sect.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 05:55;0;1;There are multiple ways to ascertain truth. Reason/logic plays a major role as the foundation.

LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 05:49;0;1;All Catholic doctrines were revealed by God to the Apostles during their lifetimes, either by the oral teaching of Christ (which includes many things not documented in Scripture, mind you) or by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 05:42;0;1;Protestants are all over the place with what they reject, but universally, they all reject the papacy. Most also reject good works and indulgences too. All of these doctrines, however, came from God, and are therefore perfect in of themselves.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 05:33;0;0;No, Luther had issues with himself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 05:33;0;1;This fraud was NEVER a Catholic priest at all, at any point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 05:31;0;1;Protestants did not reform anything. They revolted against the legitimate authorities placed over them by God, and rejected God's doctrine in favour of their own man-made religion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 05:30;0;1;It's easier to help them if the distinction is clearer.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 05:30;0;0;You kept retweeting what I said with a response, rather than replying to it. Maybe it was intentional, but I've seen people who retweet every reply, and it gets annoying (since it means one cannot go back and see the history of the conversation easily).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 05:29;0;1;Well, we all deserve Hell. Were it not for God's grace, you or I could be in that situation too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 05:28;0;0;(In any case, even if there was no possible way to recover the papacy, it would not justify rejecting the Catholic doctrine that heretics cannot under any circumstances be popes. We would still need to accept the situation, and admit we just don't know the answer.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 05:27;0;0;Finally, there is always a possibility of divine intervention. Multiple canonized saints have given prophesies approved by the Church, describing Sts. Peter and Paul coming down from Heaven to appoint a pope at some future time. That could be the end of the present situation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 05:25;0;0;"Also, there is precedent (ending the Western Schism) for even illegitimate cardinals being acceptable to participate in a legitimate conclave. So the bigger problem here is that these cardinals"" are not Catholics. If they were to elect a Catholic, it'd make sense to accept him.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 05:24;0;0;"When a law becomes impossible, it loses force automatically (Canon Law is explicit on this). Thus, in absence of cardinals, the Church can appoint a pope through some other means (either elected by all the bishops, or the clergy of Rome; which one is unclear to me).";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 05:22;0;1;There is zero chance protestantism is true, and therefore zero circumstances where I would become a protestant. If Catholicism were somehow untrue, I would have no other logical option but to renounce Christ entirely.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 05:07;1;2;I don't understand. How would making it clearer (by more egregious deviations from the Faith), make it harder to find or return to the truth?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 05:06;1;1;If such heresies are not sufficient to constitute a distinct office entirely, shouldn't this denial of having papal authority at least imply a refusal of the election/designation, allowing another pope to be elected immediately?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.08.2018 04:51;0;1;And yes, Catholicism IS absolute. That's inherent to what Catholicism is. To be a Catholic means to reject V2, and to accept V2 means to reject Catholicism. The principle of non-contradiction applies.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.08.2018 00:14;0;1;Accidents happen, even without the death penalty. People get hit and killed by cars fairly often. That doesn't mean we should stop driving.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.08.2018 00:13;0;1;We can probably do a lot better. The real problem is nobody is seriously trying at this point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.08.2018 00:13;0;0;Someone who might second-guess the jury's judgement would be a bad fit for the job of executioner.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.08.2018 00:12;0;0;Executioners shouldn't be ordinary people. Some people have a drive to kill, or at least an immunity to guilt over it, and those people are better fit for the job of justified killing. It's not the executioner's job to judge his targets.

LukeDashjr;22.08.2018 00:10;0;1;Ah, so to convict the jury who gave the death penalty, you must prove [beyond a reasonable doubt] that their judgement was unreasonable? I guess that's logical. But if you can do that, why wait for the victim to be executed? Why not try the jury immediately for neglect of duty?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.08.2018 00:09;0;0;My point is that evidence can very well be overwhelmingly clear that Joe committed murder, and in reality, Joe didn't. Such situations are unfortunate and hopefully can be avoided as much as possible, but they seem to inevitably occur once in a while.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.08.2018 00:08;0;2;You don't have unreasonable doubts?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.08.2018 00:05;0;0;I wonder if there's a good way to make juries culpable for giving a negligent verdict either way. ie, if the accused is found not guilty, and then commits a crime again, the jury is somehow held accountable.

LukeDashjr;22.08.2018 00:03;0;1;(And in some cases, the accused might even become convinced himself that he did it, even if he has no memories of it!);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.08.2018 00:03;0;1;But what if it really WAS aliens taking over the accused's body for the crime? No reasonable person would accept that argument, but the accused is still innocent.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.08.2018 00:01;0;0;But then the jury might neglect their duty by simply not ever giving guilty verdicts... At the very least, such a thing needs to be conditional on showing bad faith from the jury member(s).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2018 23:59;0;0;Accidents aren't murder.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.08.2018 22:33;0;1;Hopefully such cases would be dropped prior to prosecution (or even not charged in the first place), but things like duress, being tricked, etc could mitigate culpability.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2018 22:31;0;0;You know fatherhood is life-long too, right? And we have to put up with the hormonal behaviours too. None of that justifies murder, in any case.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;18.08.2018 04:44;0;1;Tonal is a base 8*2 system of units, measures, etc invented in the 19th century.

LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 06:06;0;0;There are no denominations in God's Church, only in the false religion of protestantism.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 05:56;0;0;Popes don't intercede per se. They teach and govern us. But even atheists will be rewarded in this lifetime for their good deeds - it is only salvation that depends on being Catholic.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 05:55;0;0;Don't get me wrong - I'm not saying God doesn't ever do things like this. That's just not what He has chosen as His ordinary means of teaching religion.

LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 05:50;0;1;Except it doesn't do anything for these political environments...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 05:46;0;1;Obedience to the popes is not a guarantee of Heaven, merely one condition. To believe in Christ, means to believe everything He taught - including the papacy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 05:43;0;1;You didn't. I just don't want to mix up the two arguments. Without the blockchain, everyone can still check and count the votes themselves.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 05:40;0;1;The Holy Ghost guides only the Catholic Church, not individuals making it up as they go along (protestantism).

LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 05:38;0;2;Let's stick to one-person-one-vote here. Shares are an entirely different matter. In that context, blockchains don't do anything special for what you just said.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 05:37;0;1;Protestants have filled in the gaps of their understanding with man-made ideas contrary to Christ's actual teachings.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 05:37;0;1;So while we accept the entirety of the Bible as God's word, we also have a very good understanding of its correct meaning, as well as teachings of Jesus that were not considered relevant when the Bible was written.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 05:35;0;0;But more importantly: Christ did not write the Bible. He established the Catholic Church, and guaranteed it would preserve and teach His doctrine. The Bible was later put together by Catholics, but was never intended to encompass the entirety of the religion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 05:34;0;0;The Bible is mostly the same. The difference there, is that protestants misinterpret it contrary to how the writers intended it. (Most protestants today also reject 7 books of the Old Testament, but this isn't usually relevant.);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 05:30;0;0;Jesus gave men the authority to forgive (or retain!) sins. He did not offer any other option for (post-Baptismal) forgiveness. Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them;;;;;;https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1027758989759660032;;
LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 05:26;0;3;They don't raise the cost beyond what a simple flood network could. The only reason Bitcoin needs a blockchain is to prevent double-spending, but for voting that can be simplified to double votes cancelling each other out.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 05:24;0;0;That isn't what Christ taught, though. He established a hierarchical institution (the Catholic Church) to teach and lead us. Just as Noah's ark was the only way to avoid the Flood, the Catholic Church is the only way to escape the punishment for our sins.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 05:23;0;1;You mean issuance of the voter keys? That's inherently centralised. There's no way to avoid that. And also easily mitigated by people who don't get keys complaining loudly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 05:19;0;1;Forget the centralised vote registration, it's not relevant. Could just as well flood all the votes on a p2p network.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 05:12;0;3;...Everyone can verify their own vote was counted, total #of votes, etc, and the final outcome of the vote. What do you think a blockchain provides on top of this?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.08.2018 05:12;0;1;So let's discuss an alternative to our current system: Everyone is assigned a signing key. Everyone can verify the total number of signing keys issued. Government collects signed votes, and distributes them with a tree hash. ...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 21:06;0;0;Yes, all governments get their (limited) authority from God, and are subject to Him. Outside of the authority God gives them, they are nothing but organized crime.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 21:02;0;0;Of course not. Mrs. Clinton would have been justified to permanently separate from her husband (arguably even morally obliged to do so!).

LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 21:00;0;0;Why do you assume I don't pray for him? I do, and I also support his presidency. There is nothing hateful about calling him out on one of his worst ongoing public sins, for which he will be damned if he doesn't repent.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 20:53;0;0;How is it more reasonable to assume an illegal immigrant would commit another crime, than to assume an illegal speeder would? Both are violations of civil laws governing physical location.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 20:52;0;0;You seem to be confusing false-pope Francis and his sect for the Catholic Church. They aren't really, just frauds. The real Catholic Church does not tolerate divorce, supports capital punishment, condemns secularism, and doesn't have a pedo epidemic.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 20:47;0;0;Then you are a liberal, by definition.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 20:46;0;0;Catholicism is not a denomination. It is exclusively Christ's one true religion, and the only means He established for the salvation of souls.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 20:44;0;0;Wrong. They are universal law.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 20:43;0;0;Yes it is. Right and wrong are the same for everyone.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 20:42;0;1;So if a cop lets you go for speeding, and you later rape someone, suddenly that cop should be held as an accessory to rape?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 20:39;0;0;No, you need three rights for that. Since wrongs don't make rights, you won't ever get a left out of it. /s;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 20:38;0;0;We should all know what is OBJECTIVELY right and wrong, yes. But that is very different from making up your own subjective morals.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 20:33;0;1;Sure, I agree, but the matter of rape is an unrelated one.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 20:31;0;0;But God does not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 20:31;0;0;At this very moment, I am not sinning, and regret all my past sins. An ongoing relationship of adultery is not a past sin, it is a present sin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 20:30;0;0;Trump's adulterous relationship with Melania is NOT past. It is present. Neither is his marriage to Ivana the past. It is also the present, and will remain so until one of them passes away. The government has no authority to dissolve a marriage.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 20:28;0;0;Why not? It's not a requirement for a passport, as far as I can tell (and I have a passport myself)...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 20:24;0;0;No, civil divorce is literally liberalism. The government does not have any authority to dissolve marriages.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 20:03;0;0;I don't commit adultery. (See how that doesn't apply when you take it out of context?);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 19:40;0;0;Are you saying *all* illegal immigrants are rapists?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.08.2018 19:21;0;1;(Also, Melania is not really FLOTUS. She is Trump's adulterous/illegitimate mistress, not his wife, who is Ivana, so long as she shall live.);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 22:33;0;2;You should do the encryption on your CPU, not the drive firmware. So the disk never sees the unencrypted data, encryption keys, etc at all, and cannot lie to you.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 21:56;2;5;Your keys won't tell you if you have any bitcoins. That's the job of your full node. Having the keys safe is useless if you don't know if you have any bitcoins to sign for.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 19:50;0;0;In any case, I'm not saying you're wrong. Bitcoin very likely IS at risk right now. Which is why we really SHOULD reduce the block sizes ASAP.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 19:24;0;0;With Bitcoin, you can't know it is, until you do it. And for your audit to be meaningful, everyone else needs to be doing it too.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 19:13;0;4;Bitcoin doesn't work at all unless most people are running their own node. But no, nodes aren't particularly bad for the environment.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 19:12;2;5;If people don't run nodes, the system and incentives cease to exist. $200 laptop is probably capable of running a node today. But with blocks being so large, that may come to an end...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 18:51;0;1;Cost to use Bitcoin has been continually increasing DESPITE improvements to hardware. If we wanted to make it so the cost remained the same, we'd need to reduce block size to 300k.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 18:50;5;10;You seem to be looking at block size as if blocks are the resource itself. But that's not true - the resource is the block*chain*, and block size is merely the *increase rate*. The improvements to cost of hardware haven't even kept up with 1 MB, much less larger sizes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 18:47;0;2;Sounds about right...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 05:33;0;0;Yep, it is. Not going to waste [what would probably take me years] to prove the Catholic religion to someone who clearly isn't interested in the truth anyway. Pearls before swine and all that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 05:17;0;0;Perhaps we should see about getting that changed.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 04:53;0;0;No, everyone is born with a knowledge that God exists.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 04:51;0;0;BTW, did you get the point that I am not good either? Almost nobody is good. All it takes is one bad thing, to make us bad.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 04:50;0;0;I don't have to know everything about you. There is no such thing as a newborn atheist. Denial of God is something you choose to do later in life.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 04:37;0;0;Yes, it is. Atheism is bad, therefore every atheist is also bad.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 04:21;0;1;Very few people, even priests, are perfect.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 04:20;0;0;Probably in part because she murders witnesses planning to testify against her...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 01:33;0;0;There is only one God. But the details about Him are not relevant to the question of atheists.

LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 00:45;0;2;To reach the maximum block size, you would need a custom block with just one transaction designed specifically for that purpose.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 00:45;0;0;It's just like a USB modem - it can't access your RAM directly or do anything to compromise your system. Even if the cellular modem was completely open source, the cellular tower isn't, and it's the same kind of relationship.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 00:39;2;5;Blocks are only required to have 80 (header) + 1 (number of txs) + 60 (min tx size) + 64 (min generation tx size) = 205 bytes of non-witness data.

LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 00:24;0;0;4 MB is block size, not weight. Weight isn't measured in bytes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 00:24;0;1;Yes, any further increases will need a hardfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.08.2018 00:23;0;2;You don't understand UASFs... Only nodes with economic usage are relevant.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 22:02;0;1;No, there is no legitimate choice to murder your child. Parents who do that should be locked up (if insane) or executed. At least someone mutilating himself isn't hurting anyone else.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 21:38;0;0;That's what abortion is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 21:37;0;0;There is NO difference. That's the point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 21:37;0;0;Exactly the same thing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 21:37;0;0;As if the age matters. Murder is murder.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 21:35;0;0;Same thing applies there too.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 20:03;0;0;I don't advocate for illegal abortions. People found guilty (in a fair trial) of abortion should be executed, so it doesn't really matter what it does to their body.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 19:30;0;0;The reason killing people is wrong, is because it infringes on God's exclusive right to decide matters of life & death of humans.

LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 19:28;0;0;I don't go to his rallys and don't follow him on Twitter. Better things to do with my time.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 19:26;0;0;I don't excuse any of it. I simply said his actions as president have exceeded my (low) expectations.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 19:17;0;0;That's nothing but unfounded slander.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 19:16;0;0;I didn't say Trump was perfect.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 19:09;0;2;Why would fake popes care about logic when doing fake canonizations?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 19:08;0;0;Discrediting liars is a good thing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 19:07;0;0;Clinton isn't America.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 19:06;0;0;Indeed it did! Much better than I had expected, actually.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 19:06;0;0;Trump does much less damage to the presidency than Clinton would have, given the opportunity.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 19:04;0;0;Better a crapshoot with no brain, than an evil mastermind. But it's hard to believe Trump can have accomplished as much good as he has, if he didn't have a brain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 19:03;0;0;"Right there on the bottom-left: …I will…defend the Constitution of the United States…"" Catholics consider [at least parts of] the Constitution to be indefensible. In particular, its explicit denial of God's authority over the government.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 19:01;0;1;Clinton openly supports the ongoing massacre of the unborn. Trump is at least trying to put an end to it, and making more progress on that front than any of the last several presidents.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 19:01;0;0;Leaking legitimate/real info that the people have a right to know, is not propaganda, and is not interference. Interference would be Clinton trying to deceive the public by hiding that info. But yes, our options sucked.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 16:14;0;2;No, she really is a criminal. Unfortunately, our government hasn't prosecuted her yet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 16:14;0;0;We'd be in a much worse mess.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 16:13;0;1;Probably because he's accomplishing more good than any of the past few decades of presidents?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 16:11;0;0;No, ends cannot justify means.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 16:11;0;0;No, it isn't. It is a rational decision.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 16:10;0;1;I voted against Clinton, who was/is much worse than Trump.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 16:09;0;0;No, she didn't win, and if she runs again, I will have to mark Trump on my ballot again. Almost anyone is better than Clinton.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 16:09;0;0;2 children only delays SS by one year IF you opt-in to this. If you don't have children, SS is completely unaffected for you by this bill.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 16:07;0;0;I have seen no evidence Trump is racist, and no evidence Clinton would have been anything but much worse.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 16:06;0;1;Inherently, no. Your phone is carried with you on your person, and (relatively) easily lost or stolen.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 16:05;0;0;In theory, one could re-register to change party affiliation, but I don't know that my being Catholic would go unnoticed again, so I would be jeopardizing my ability to vote at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 16:04;0;1;# Florida bans people from voting if they're # Catholic, but I managed to get registered anyway (someone didn't check the registration form) - however, they registered me as an independent. The primaries are closed here, so independents don't get to participate in primaries.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 15:55;0;0;Not nearly as big a stain as the last few decades of presidents. At least Trump is accomplishing *some* good.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 15:54;0;0;No backtracking. I publicly supported Darrell Castle up until the very last moment when I was convinced he couldn't win.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 15:53;0;0;Wrong. Clinton would have been even worse.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 08:33;0;0;I don't have a vote in primaries.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 08:26;0;7;We didn't really vote FOR Trump, just AGAINST Clinton. Bring in someone at least half-decent next time please.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 02:35;0;0;I think he means better educated people are less likely to become criminals. (I'm not sure that's actually true.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 01:52;0;1;Yes. He isn't a pope, nor even a Catholic.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 01:51;0;0;No, to say doctrine can change is condemned heresy.http://www.papalencyclicals.net/pius10/p10pasce.htm …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 01:50;0;1;That's just further proof Francis is a fraud. Another topic for another thread.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 01:35;0;0;If you deny the Divine origin of Catholic doctrine, or say that doctrine can be changed, you are denying the Catholic religion, and therefore not Catholic, by definition.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 01:34;0;3;Popes are infallible under specific circumstances. But more importantly, someone who denies doctrine (eg, by trying to change it) cannot become or remain pope by that fact alone. In other words, trying to change doctrine means he's not a pope, and has NO authority at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2018 01:27;0;2;Catholic doctrine was revealed by God Himself to the Apostles nearly 2000 years ago. It is absolutely not man-made.

LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 23:05;0;5;The Church hasn't split. The Novus Ordo sect simply left it. Just like the Orthodox and Protestants left before them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 22:59;0;0;So we should require every adult to carry a gun, yes?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 22:58;0;0;Why not? It's very inefficient to have a dedicated security person just for the rare incident. It's not like teaching needs to be ongoing during such incidents either - the teacher role can stop when the defense role is needed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 22:51;1;1;Seatbelts save the life of the person wearing it. Guns save the life of the person wielding it. So you're saying we should pass laws to require guns, right?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 22:49;0;1;The Earth doesn't produce resources. Humans do, using the Earth. More people = more production. 93 square metres.

LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 21:14;0;0;Francis's sect has been teaching the opposite of Catholic doctrines for centuries now, ever since their formation following the French Revolution. An intellectually honest # Catholic should have never recognised Francis's claim to be pope in the first place.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 21:12;0;1;JP2's catechism always taught heresy.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:46;1;0;Again, the only way to prevent criminality, is to arm the victims.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:45;0;0;Then who does? You're not seriously suggesting we should have NOBODY responsible for protecting our children while they're at school? (In that case, it would be negligence to send your child to school!);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:44;1;0;1) Make it easier for people to acquire guns for their own protection. 2) Restore gun safety and usage classes in the school systems.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:35;0;0;Liability for a gun is or should be less than their liability for protecting their students. Should we start prosecuting teachers for their neglect in not even trying to protect students from shooters?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:34;0;0;In any case, once you get government-subjective, then you lose the basis to argue for changes to government: if the government says criminals have no voting rights, then they don't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:33;0;0;Well, I don't see the ACLU or anyone else working to give Catholics voting rights in Florida. So clearly there is no right here either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:31;0;0;I'm not sure living underground is practical. Humans need sunlight etc.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:30;0;0;It doesn't have to be a productive garden. Lots of houses have roofs made of plant life.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:30;0;1;Liar.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:29;0;0;Your conclusion does not follow from your argument...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:27;0;0;No, it isn't. Monarchy is a perfectly legitimate form of government, and has zero voters. Additionally, # Florida doesn't even technically allow # Catholic citizens to vote, because we consider the US Constitution to be indefensible in part.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:26;0;0;I don't think you can have solar panels and gardens in the same area...?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:25;0;0;So positive Church law overrules the Divine Law that establishes choosing a pope to be the clergy's duty? I don't think so. Besides, Canon Law is *explicit* that impossible laws are not binding.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:24;0;0;Not in Florida, IIRC.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:23;0;1;For the sake of children unable to defend themselves, I suggest we enact laws that anyone responsible for the care of children (at least others' children), should be trained in gun safety, and carry a firearm for the duration of their providing such care.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:22;0;4;Enable the victims to resist, by making it easy for them to be armed. That's all you can do. (Unless you want a police State where government is constantly watching and ready to act anywhere, but NO THANKS...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:21;0;0;Voting isn't a right.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:18;1;0;There is. We can be armed and prepared to use our own guns to stop the crime when we see it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:17;0;1;Of course, we need to be careful that people suffering from mental illness don't do something that they don't really want to do. But that's true with or without guns.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:17;0;1;"If an ex-criminal has been released from prison, it should be safe to say he isn't a threat to society anymore (if he is, don't release him!), and has his rights restored (including the right to self-defense).

LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:16;0;0;I don't see how it could possibly be contrary to God's will? God established the Church with the papacy, and gave the clergy the duty of filling the office...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:13;0;0;Interesting. Do platforms on the water change this significantly? Sounds like the same amount should migrate, if the migration is based on ocean CO2 deficiency?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;4.08.2018 20:11;0;0;Any adult should be able to buy manual or semi-automatic (= normal!) firearms just like we buy milk or bread. No background checks: everyone has a right to defend themselves (if a criminal is a threat to society, he should be behind bars, not at Walmart).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 09:39;0;2;Here is St. Robert Bellarmine's explanation, for your convenience: https://novusordowatch.org/de-romano-pontifice-book2-chapter30/ … (You probably know Latin anyway and don't need the translation, but it's what I have.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 09:26;0;0;Also, these things are Catholic doctrine, which means unless you believe them, you are not a Catholic yourself...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 09:26;0;0;"No. Catholicism is God's interpretation. Catholicism is NOT a branch, and there will only ever be one Church. There is no salvation outside the Church, no matter how good"" a person might act.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 09:22;0;0;No, then they are still executed and sent off to their Judgement.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 09:22;0;0;"Also, Pope Paul IV explicitly taught that those thus promoted or elevated shall be deprived automatically, and without need for any further declaration, of all dignity, position, honour, title, authority, office and power.""""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 09:21;0;0;While it may be true that authority is needed for a canonical judgement, it is clear that no such judgement is needed to impede becoming pope. After all, if he has unanimous support from the cardinals, the cardinals will not judge him.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 09:20;0;0;"If only the college of cardinals can make that judgement, why did Pope Paul IV teach explicitly that the promotion or elevation [of a heretic], even if it shall have been uncontested and by the unanimous assent of all the Cardinals, shall be null, void and worthless""?""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 09:16;0;0;"As a computer/technical person, it feels"" like some non-standard Twitter app that doesn't show or post things the normal way. If it wasn't 3 AM, I'd consider calling him on the phone...""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 09:15;0;0;This isn't about papal infallibility.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 09:14;0;0;"Catholicism is traditionalist"". There is no such thing as non-""traditionalist"" Catholicism, only heresy. Modernism is condemned.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 09:12;1;2;There seem to be multiple possibilities, but more importantly, we don't need to know all the answers for the future. We *do* need to assent to Catholic doctrine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 09:04;0;0;He ceases to be pope by the very fact of teaching heresy. So at the same time he becomes a heretic, he also ceases to be pope. Hence, heretics cannot be popes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 09:03;0;0;I agree completely. A manifest heretic like Francis could never have been pope in the first place. He is wearing the clothes, but has no authority.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 09:02;0;0;The Church is guided by the Holy Ghost, and guaranteed to never teach error in faith or morals. Papal infallibility has always been believed ever since the time of the Apostles - the formal definition at the Vatican Council merely reaffirmed and clarified the exact requirements.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 08:59;0;0;Indeed. Most heretics never purport to teach ex cathedra. If that was necessary, then ONLY popes could become heretics.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 08:58;0;0;"Francis has always been a heretic, and was thus never eligible to become pope in the first place. He is nothing but a fraud masquerading as pope"", with no authority whatsoever.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 08:54;0;0;"I have no idea what you mean by Vangelum"". The Church does not make mistakes when teaching on matters of faith or morals.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 08:53;0;0;The [first] Vatican Council considered the topic as well, and while it did not formally define it as so, it too came to the conclusion that no pope had ever been a heretic.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 08:51;0;0;John XXII taught explicitly as a private opinion, and explicitly admitted that he might be wrong, something contrary to a doctrine LATER defined. This isn't heresy, just an erroneous opinion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 08:51;0;0;Honorious merely failed to condemn the heresy of his era, and for that he was post-humorously condemned to be counted among the heretics, but he himself as a matter of fact never taught the heresy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 08:48;0;0;St. Robert Bellarmine taught that heretics ipso facto cannot be popes. While he did explain the opposing views (that a heretic could be a pope), he rejected those. Furthermore, the Church also explicitly defined that heretics cannot become popes. No pope was ever a heretic.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 08:47;0;0;Nope. The New Testament supports capital punishment too, as has the Church throughout the nearly 2000 years afterward.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 08:46;0;1;That does not logically follow. It is unfortunate that there is not a pope at this time, but that doesn't mean denying the reality.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 08:45;0;0;Everyone sentenced to death should be given one last opportunity to make a valid confession.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 08:44;0;0;But objectively, only one of them is teaching heresy. And that is Francis's sect.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 08:44;0;0;Lefevbre was/is not Bishop Sanborn.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 08:40;1;2;If you mean a V2 priest, then you did not become a Catholic priest (yet?). But it's not too late to follow in the steps of Fr.

LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 08:13;0;0;It is *because* I have a clue, that I know Francis is a heretic and not a pope at all. I recommend reading through Bishop Sanborn's Q&A: http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/SSPX_QA_RevPDF2.pdf …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 07:59;0;0;It is an objective fact that Francis is not a pope, per Catholic doctrine. Even if you deny this objective fact, it remains true (as do all objective facts) for everyone.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 07:57;0;1;Mercy is only permissible for those who repent of their crimes. To grant it to an unrepentant criminal would be a miscarriage of justice.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 07:55;0;0;Religious indifference and religious liberty are condemned heresies. Catholics cannot support them. Also, we know from science that human life begins at conception. While it is not strictly heresy to deny this, falsehoods are no basis for law.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 07:47;0;0;Sometimes, putting it into clear words means expounding upon the previously-written words, but these details always originate from the original Deposit of Faith given to the Apostles. They are not invented, as if mere man can innovate upon God's doctrine.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.08.2018 05:19;0;0;I agree. A life sentence also punishes the criminal's wife (even if she was the victim), since she remains unable to marry anyone else until he dies.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.08.2018 21:36;0;0;Most heretics never promulgate anything. Heresy is still heresy. You continue to assert he is pope, but the Catholic Faith teaches that he cannot be. Assertions do not overrule the Faith.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.07.2018 20:00;0;4;Yes, Bitcoin does work as a cash system. Fees are irrelevant to that. And fees are pretty low, even for on-chain transactions.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.07.2018 19:54;0;0;History doesn't support your claims. The papacy has always held universal jurisdiction, including the first 1054 years.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.07.2018 19:25;0;0;And no, not everything is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a specific cryptocurrency.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.07.2018 19:24;3;7;The whitepaper was never intended to be more than a high-level overview of a small part of the system. Bitcoin 0.1 was both more than (and also less than) the whitepaper. It included basic (albeit broken) support for off-chain transactions from day 1.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.07.2018 16:00;0;0;Except it is the Orthodox that have changed doctrine, not the Catholics.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.07.2018 15:59;0;0;The evidence is so clear, that honest protestants who look into the issue either end up converting to Catholicism, or at least admitting St. Peter had such authority while denying his successors did.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.07.2018 15:58;0;0;No, they were never supposed to be equal, and never behaved that way. Even as early as the Council of Jerusalem, documented in Acts 15, St. Peter himself exercised papal authority.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.07.2018 15:56;0;0;1) Faith is not necessarily *blind* faith. 2) Faith comes into play when you decide to trust what God has told and promised us, not merely to establish His existence. The only reason God can't be possibly disproven, is because the proofs are that strong.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.07.2018 08:15;0;0;Not really. That's basically like saying you can't help yourself if you rape someone or commit adultery, which everyone hopefully admits is ridiculous.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.07.2018 07:33;3;29;Yes, it's subtly different. If you don't carry a gun, the only one at risk is yourself - if you get killed or mugged, society will try to deal with it after the fact. But if you don't run a full node, you create economic pressure favouring the attacker, hurting Bitcoin overall.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.07.2018 07:02;0;0;No, it doesn't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.07.2018 07:01;0;1;History is clear on the Orthodox breaking off of the Catholic Church.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.07.2018 03:33;0;0;The Modernists have always been Modernists, and the Catholic Church has never been.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.07.2018 03:32;0;0;Heretics aren't in our tent.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.07.2018 02:14;0;1;Although the formal courts of the Holy Inquisition unfortunately are no longer functional, the same Catholic Church does still exist (and hasn't had any recent accusations of pedophile clergy to act on anyway).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.07.2018 02:12;0;0;There is a total of like TWO legitimate Catholic priests (and zero bishops) in all of Australia. The coverups are an unrelated heretic religion trying to usurp the Catholic Church's name. The mass media goes along with it to make Catholics look bad.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.07.2018 22:20;0;3;Probably because POWER9 isn't available in a mobile form factor? Perhaps they could strip it down to one or two cores to get power/heat down, but nobody's tried yet AFAIK.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.07.2018 22:20;1;2;I see no reason to prefer Libreboot specifically. Only difference I notice, is that the Talos boot firmware takes a rather long time to start (a minute or two IIRC). But how often do you reboot your PC?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.07.2018 21:54;0;0;Actually, 1+2=10 (in trinary). Yes, the objective meaning is the same, but this applies to Bitcoin too.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.07.2018 21:29;0;0;BIP148 would not have caused any split. The only risk of a split, was if miners produced invalid blocks - but they can do that at any time, with or without BIP148, to cause a split.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.07.2018 17:48;2;5;@ QubesOS won't work, but that says more about Qubes than it does about POWER. So long as Qubes only runs on backdoored PCs, it is nothing but a false sense of security.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.07.2018 17:44;0;0;My father-in-law has, and so we have ceased all communication with him. Don't need to meet people to know that adultery is gravely wrong. Don't know why you think rights are involved in this. Nobody has a right to adultery.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.07.2018 07:39;0;2;Gossip is in fact a real sin, though. (As is detraction - revealing others' faults when they are true, when the other party does not have a right to know them.) Don't throw out the baby with the bathwater.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.07.2018 07:37;0;3;It may be good that we're (kindof) working through these issues now. *Eventually*, humanity will need much more efficient food production if we are to ever fulfil God's command to fill the Earth.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.07.2018 07:20;0;0;I also prefer solutions that address the real problem for everyone (such as the @ ParentalRights amendment), not merely emotional-kneejerk favouring a specific minority group, while leaving the real problem as-is for everyone else.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.07.2018 07:03;0;1;AFAIK, but I could be wrong.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;27.07.2018 22:05;0;0;The case where it matters, is if someone who suffers from the attractions goes to therapy.

LukeDashjr;27.07.2018 22:02;0;0;Normally I don't label people because of their temptations, but @ marklutchman's original tweet seemed to be doing so - perhaps I misinterpreted.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.07.2018 22:01;0;1;No, I'm saying merely suffering from the attraction isn't a crime. Once they've actually abused/molested a child, sure, capital punishment.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 22:13;0;1;There are many reasons they might not have done that, but it isn't evidence that they don't have the hashrate they have (which may not be 90%, but is certainly more than 50%). Also, they couldn't collapse Bitcoin, just impair it temporarily.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 21:04;0;0;BCH's potential as a no-confidence hardfork was why the Segwit BIPs took 3 months (the timeout for such attempts, per BIP 2) before being marked as Final status. But even after 3 months, Bitcoin continues on separately from BCH, so BCH clearly is not Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 21:02;2;2;https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1005996403288616960 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 21:01;0;3;As others have pointed out, putting all their hashrate in a different legal entity helps them avoid giving up control of it, as well as protects them from being legally called out on this lie.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 21:01;0;0;They have a lot more than 4% physically owned/operated.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 20:33;0;0;"They explicitly control a LOT more than 4% (evidence suggests well over 50%). The not counting subsidiaries"" explanation seems most plausible.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 20:31;4;11;No, they have over 50% in category #1 alone. If we were to include the other two categories, it would be over 90%.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 20:31;0;0;Citing is just deferring to another authority... which in this case, there isn't anyone more authoritative to defer to. If you want to fact check, you need to actually check facts. That's how it works.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 20:12;0;0;Still part of the empire as far as the Bitcoin network is concerned. Splitting off to different legal entities means nothing really.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 20:11;0;4;I suspect at the very least, they are leaving out all the hashrate used by their cloud mining services...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 19:41;0;2;They're obviously lying.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 19:33;32;169;Bitmain apparently claims to have under 4% of the network hashrate. Do they think we're idiots? https://twitter.com/BITMAINtech/status/1022086217507135489 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 19:21;0;3;"On censuses, I usually put human"" for race. ""Native American"" would arguably work too, but that might confuse the census.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 19:19;0;1;MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE was only ever enforced against the size of a stripped block, NOT the size of the full block.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 19:17;0;1;I suspect maybe about half of the 20% did resist, in the form of launching BCH. But there were probably a good 10% or so that simply didn't really care.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 19:14;0;4;When there is divergence into two chains, the one that remains Bitcoin, is the one that pre-change nodes accept. (If pre-change nodes don't accept any, then it'd be debatable, I suppose.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 19:13;2;10;The difference is that with a softfork, consent is the default, whereas with a hardfork, opposition is the default. Either way, users can still explicitly consent/support or oppose - the difference lies in the default behaviour.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 19:12;0;0;Dunno, but what I would do is immaterial.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 19:11;0;0;It is (or should be) in miners' interests for the network to be well-functioning, which both removed policies helped.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 19:10;0;3;But the resistance would need to be active. Users who simply used the prior version wouldn't be resisting it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 19:09;0;1;Segwit only had 80% support, not consensus. The difference is that it was a softfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 19:07;0;0;Because it is literally the same currency, even if the rules changed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 19:07;0;0;I'm not sure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 19:05;0;6;An important technical difference. Undisputed Bitcoin users (ie, those running the version prior to the change) will accept a softfork, but they won't accept a hardfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 19:04;0;1;Neither. It's the protocol enforced by the community.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 19:03;0;1;4 MB is the max size, not weight. (Weight isn't a measure of bytes.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 19:03;0;0;Know of a team interested in a vacation in Florida? Although I guess licensing would make that difficult... And if it never happens here, who knows if the environment differences will interfere...?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 19:00;0;0;A reverse BIP148 would have itself been a softfork, and BIP148 would have been resisting the reverse-BIP148.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 18:59;0;5;That's how hardforks and softforks work...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 18:59;0;1;The previous Bitcoin continues to exist.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 18:58;0;0;Huh? Your link contradicts your tweet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 18:53;1;8;But Segwit was not a hardfork, so it didn't need consensus, just absence of active opposition.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 18:52;0;0;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/decidedly …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 18:51;0;0;2X was non-Bitcoin, so that is decidedly NOT an example. Examples I would give, are the removal of coin-age priority and soft max-block-size policies. A particular political subset of Core developers have managed to make it so only their incentives-only policy is allowed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 18:48;0;1;Consensus is needed for a hardfork, not to remain on Bitcoin as-is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 18:47;0;0;No, BIPs are merely a way of documenting proposals. Whether the community accepts them or not is another matter.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 18:45;0;0;No, he is correct on this point. With BIP148, Segwit lock-in was literally Aug 1st. (Or I suppose earlier, when BIP148 got sufficient support, but there is no clear date to point to there.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 18:43;0;1;There is no 1 MB segwit chain. Segwit upgraded Bitcoin to 2-4 MB.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 18:40;0;1;Yes, I'll move it to the main release and update the PPA soonish. (Assuming you mean 0.16.1);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 18:39;0;0;lolwut? So if someone chooses not to blackmail/detract you, suddenly that decision has some insane cash value that you can be considered liable for? Am I understanding you right?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 18:36;0;0;So avoiding them isn't actually practical?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 18:11;0;0;BCH decidedly failed to be Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 18:09;0;1;No, he is correct. Segwit transactions cost relatively less than non-segwit transactions.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 18:07;0;0;Or Bitcoin Knots. While it does support Segwit, the default is to not use it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 18:05;0;0;Segwit is opt-in, but consensus rules have certainly changed. If you don't enforce consensus on others' segwit transactions, you are insecure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 18:04;1;0;Segwit increased the block size limit. That was/is objectively harmful to many users. (But nobody seems to have objected to Segwit on these grounds.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 17:58;0;1;In theory, yes, but in practice, it sometimes does not work out that way.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 17:57;0;0;Every single meaningful metric showed BIP148 having sufficient community support.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.07.2018 17:57;0;0;It would not be impossible for Core to have remained politically neutral (it used to be). It actually wasn't rushed. Even the 2013 hardfork was on a shorter timeframe.

LukeDashjr;23.07.2018 09:08;0;0;The mass media is correctly accusing and attacking a sect with serious pedophile coverup problems. The problem is that this sect is not the Catholic Church, despite their calling it that. Catholics have not had control of the Vatican for 60 years now.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.07.2018 18:56;0;1;But since we inherently know God exists, agnosticism is actually a step *beyond* atheism. It is in fact denial that God exists, but also denial of this denial!;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 22:17;0;0;Not okay with it, but it's an a few orders of magnitude less of a problem than billions being outright murdered. Public schools simply shouldn't exist at all, though. Suffering and inequality are fine - that's just part of life.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 22:14;0;0;Best source I know of is http://realdouayrheims.com/ , but I don't care much for the formatting changes he made, and I think the print versions are on normal book paper (across 4 volumes).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 22:10;0;0;Under the age of 21 isn't a fully developer human. But that's irrelevant - they're still humans, and killing them is still murder. Not just a gateway act, full fledged murder. Killing an embryo is no different than drowning a toddler.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 22:09;0;0;No, I just prefer accuracy. While Bp. Challoner's revisions may be minor or an improvement, they also omit the extensive annotations and margin notes present in the real Douay-Rheims.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 22:05;0;0;Because how you live your life might affect how others do (or can't, as is the case with murder/abortion). The victims of abortion are the *most* innocent - if we turn a blind eye to that, we should turn a blind eye to all murder.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 21:14;0;0;You are a racist for saying it matters, when it really doesn't. Also, if you want to blame someone for Trump (which is totally unrelated to this whole thread), blame the Democrats for nominating someone even worse.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 21:06;0;0;Racism exists. There's just no evidence it was relevant to this incident. Since you're trying to make it about race, it's YOU who are the racist.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 21:05;0;0;Evidence? Being pushed down is a scenario to fear, not to be embarassed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 21:04;0;0;*Both* men were justified in their actions. If the other guy had lived instead, I'd be defending him too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 21:02;0;0;Some of us *are* that fragile. And being a coward is not a crime.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 21:01;0;0;AFAICT, both men were justified in this incident.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 21:00;0;0;No, it doesn't, racist.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 20:59;0;0;Being a coward is not a crime.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 20:56;0;2;Nor should it be mentioned in the article, because it is irrelevant. Not everyone is a racist. And SYG applies equally to everyone. If nobody was killed, then SYG isn't even relevant.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 20:55;0;0;The problem here isn't SYG, but rather that # Florida law requires that firearm use must be deadly. It's not allowed to threaten to shoot, or shoot to not-kill - if we need to use a gun, we're *required* to shoot to kill.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 20:53;0;4;Actually, SYG isn't even relevant to this case: Person A could not reasonably retreat since he was pushed to the ground.https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1020739201598410752 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 20:48;0;0;Yes, it was. Being pushed down on concrete can be life-threatening. I would probably have done the same thing. (In Person B's shoes, I wouldn't have pushed, but rather tried to clarify the situation, while being prepared to shoot Person A if he made a move to harm my family.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 20:45;0;0;"Actually, SYG isn't even relevant to this case; Person B had no ground to stand"" since he came out of the store, and Person A could not retreat since he was pushed to the ground.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 20:38;0;2;Why should he be going to jail? He was simply defending himself. (And the guy assaulting him was defending his family - also justified, but that's not a reason to throw the shooter in jail.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 20:37;0;2;Note that with or without SYG, Person A is still pushed and Person B is still dead. The only difference SYG makes, is that without it, Person A would now be going to trial for simply defending himself. So SYG is itself only a good thing in this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 20:21;0;0;The federal government pays bonuses for every child they put in foster care or adopt out. Plus, they get to extort the parents for child support.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 20:09;0;0;It probably isn't a lie. Children get bruises. That's just part of normal childhood.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 20:08;0;0;Here's a few quick sources. There are many more you can find if you bother looking. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5fqaaBpTLY … https://twitter.com/ParentalRights/status/1019676182713982977 … http://reason.com/blog/2018/06/18/cps-mom-baby-cops-kidnapping … http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/141/6/e20173119#T2 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 20:04;0;0;No, you can't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 20:03;0;0;You are wrong. # CPS regularly fabricates evidence and lies to remove children from parents who have done nothing wrong. There are numerous examples of this - the cases with actual abuse are a small minority in comparison.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 19:58;0;0;No, we're talking about parents *accused* of not doing so, without proof.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 19:58;0;0;It's not murder to kill someone who is actively engaged in a crime against you and your child.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 19:57;0;0;No, it isn't revenge. If the child is still missing, you can take action to get him back, including killing people guilty of the kidnapping.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 19:56;0;0;Safeguarding children is the job of the parents, not the government.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 19:55;0;0;If I see you kidnap my child, and then later I see you out in public without my child, who is still missing, you can bet I will take action, regardless of what you've done with or relocated my child in the meantime.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 19:54;0;0;Did you know that the government refuses to exclude people with a criminal background from foster care, citing as their reason that they wouldn't have people to do the job? Did you know that some of the largest pedophile rings have been tied to child removal systems?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 19:52;0;0;Removing a child from his parents violates both the child's rights and the parents' rights. Also, the majority of child abuse occurs when the caregiver is not a parent, including especially State-managed caregivers.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 19:47;0;0;Taking someone's children is on the same order as capital punishment.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 19:46;0;0;"The Catholic position is that 1) extra-judicial killing is only appropriate when necessary to defend rights from an active attacker; 2) within the judicial system, capital punishment is permitted only for certain crimes against the natural law.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 19:42;0;0;Better than the injustices perpetuated against non-abusers. Do you also think we should have capital punishment for people accused of murder, without any proof?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 19:30;0;0;Yes, innocent until proven guilty. Also, many innocuous things leave the same affects as abuse, especially in children.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 19:25;0;0;It would be valuable to have such a site in general - we could mirror real papal encyclicals too, while leaving out the antipopes' garbage. But who has the time to do it...?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 19:23;0;0;"Be more specific. In the case of neglect, you can provide what the parents are failing to without kidnapping. When it comes to abuse"", either it's a crime, or nobody has any authority to judge the parents about it. If it's a crime, throw the parents in jail.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 19:19;0;0;"Don't get me wrong - I find it a valuable resource for convinced Catholics discussing with protestants to consult; I just wouldn't link the non-Catholics directly to it.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 19:16;0;0;Also, that page is mixing in non-religious matters like geocentrism, blurring the line between Catholicism and other positions the author holds.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 19:16;0;0;The reason I don't link that page specifically, is that in the past, I've seen cases where he really stretches to make the Bible say things it probably was never intended to. Those cases make the arguer look dishonest.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 18:47;0;0;I was thinking of a case like if the parent had murdered one child, and you knew it, but the government refused to prosecute. But I guess even in that case, you really should just wait until the other child is at risk, and then use force to stop the threat. So maybe none.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 18:36;0;0;It's not a matter of opinion, troll.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.07.2018 18:35;0;0;We can't assume the better coin will win. Scammers prevail over their victims quite often.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;17.07.2018 01:06;0;0;Bitcoin is nothing more than technology.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.07.2018 01:04;0;0;Good luck measuring out your liquid and dust gold. Without standard coinage, gold is impractical to use as currency.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 23:18;1;6;It's nonsense because Bitcoin doesn't in any way hurt the State or its authority. Also, your argument not only has false premises, it also isn't even valid.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 22:24;0;0;Gold isn't very divisible...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 22:12;1;23;Complete nonsense;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 19:46;0;3;Litecoin has no use case whatsoever. It is nothing but a scam.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 19:13;0;1;Nope, because Bitcoin actually innovated and has a purpose.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 18:37;0;0;That's a lie. The ones who killed people for having a Bible were Anglicans, not the Catholic Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 18:36;0;0;You keep repeating this nonsense, but it is still not a fact.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 18:35;0;0;Nothing has changed. Litecoin is still just as scammy now (maybe even more) as it was then.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 17:25;0;1;We're not wrong about Litecoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 17:20;0;0;That isn't a fact, it's improbable speculation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 17:15;0;2;Never heard of it, but cozying up to a woman who destroyed Libya is basically what I would expect from people protesting human rights.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 17:12;0;4;"I suggest also either eliminating the founder's seat"", having founders who are actually involved in Bitcoin, or both.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 17:10;0;2;Litecoin has been a scam since before any foundation even existed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 17:09;0;0;There is plenty of proof. I'm not just going to get into it on Twitter, certainly not with someone who has demonstrated disinterest in honest discussion on the topic.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 16:46;0;0;I'm not using false premises, though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 06:51;0;0;Logic works from one set of premises to a conclusion. So yes, it really is how logic works.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 06:08;0;0;Well, if you accept that Jesus is God, then one thing would be the fact that He left us with literally nothing else by which to learn His teachings.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 06:03;0;0;Nope. There's much more to it than simply a claim.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 05:20;0;0;The Bible is the word of God because the Catholic Church has infallibly defined that it is so. The Catholic Church's infallibility doesn't depend on the Bible for proof.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 03:10;0;0;Go away, scammer;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 01:34;0;0;They choose not to.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.07.2018 01:28;0;0;I reject your assertion. Operating based on logic is something humans are inherently capable of, and what makes us more than just mere animals in the first place.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2018 22:28;0;0;Except there was no other Republican candidate.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2018 22:27;0;0;No, Clinton lost the election...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2018 22:26;0;0;Not as stupid as Clinton supporters...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2018 18:49;0;0;Everyone who voted for him (or rather, voted against Clinton) was an American citizen, or at least not a Russian agent.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2018 18:20;0;0;No, the decision of bringing more life into the world is exclusively God's. People who try to usurp His authority are gravely sinning. Also, the planet is nowhere near overpopulated. We have a long way to go before even fulfilling the command to fill it!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2018 18:18;0;0;Only if we get a PoW change. Otherwise, probably no hope of commoners mining again.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.07.2018 04:45;0;0;Witnesses against the Clintons get murdered. That's half the problem right there. And Clinton is openly pro-murder of unborn children. Trump, despite his many flaws, is actually making progress ending the massacre.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2018 04:43;0;1;Sadly, it's not hyperbole at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2018 04:31;0;1;Occasional murders are not the same thing as a massacre...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2018 04:25;0;0;Compassion and morals have nothing to do with what other people think.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2018 03:31;0;1;See a doctor. Maybe get off Twitter if your heath can't handle the truth.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2018 03:15;0;0;The irony...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2018 01:44;0;1;Deception, lies, fraud, coverups, murder, etc are not qualifications to be president.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2018 01:35;0;2;Not sure that's true anymore... Catholics have become a rather small minority.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 22:15;0;0;Empiricism is overrated. It shouldn't be a requirement.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 22:13;0;1;Nope. This topic is in fact simple enough that anyone open-minded can understand it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 21:50;0;1;All of Catholicism is verifiable fact.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 20:50;0;2;Might be getting close to finally ending the massacre of unborn children that's been going on for 45 years now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 19:51;1;16;What is this garbage? You don't have to defend Trump to accept that he is President, or support the good he is doing as President.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 19:49;2;25;Clinton is the one of the *least qualified* women. We'd almost certainly be better off with a random woman chosen off the street. Clinton is the reason someone like Trump was able to win. Trump could never have won, if not for everyone of us voting against Clinton.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 19:40;0;0;You're the one tweeting racist things, not me.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 19:29;0;0;1) There are many people of a wide diversity of races in charge. 2) Not all white men target people of other races, and many non-white men and women do. 3) Not all white men and women are racists, and many non-white men and women are.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 19:18;0;3;Your comment is not only full of lies, but it is also racist.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 17:01;0;0;"Liberalism is anti-Christ. Jesus supported Pontius Pilate. Thou shouldst not have any power against me, unless it were given thee from above. Therefore, he that hath delivered me to thee, hath the greater sin.""""";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 16:52;0;13;That's not privilege, it's just police corruption and abuse of power. *Nobody* should have to suffer false accusations. P.S. You should stop pretending to be a bishop.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 16:40;0;0;I remember Megaupload as merely an annoying file hosting website that other people rarely put their downloads on, and that was a pain to download from on the rare occasion I had any interest in getting such files (I might have even given up on occasion I didn't care enough).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 16:17;0;0;That doesn't make sense. Laws can't overrule technical impossibility.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 16:03;0;0;Haven't seen any evidence that Trump is a Russian stooge.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 16:02;0;0;"1) That's not what it says. 2) It seems to define enemy"" as someone we're at war with. 3) The crime wasn't against the US. It was against DNC/Clinton.""";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 16:00;0;0;Spying is in generally typically a crime in the target country too. Yet every nation does it, and it's not typically considered an act of war.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 06:22;1;6;1) DMC/Clintons are not America. 2) Spying is not an act of war. We spy on everyone, even allies.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 05:55;0;0;That's what 18 U.S. Code § 2381 seems to suggest, but IANAL.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 03:52;0;0;Nobody said anything about coincidences. You're engaging in the strawman fallacy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.07.2018 01:57;4;39;How do you figure? We're not at war with Russia. The alleged crime was also committed against DNC/Clinton, not the USA. Trump hasn't been implicated in the crime yet either, AFAIK.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 23:23;0;1;Ah, makes sense now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 23:20;0;2;I haven't lost many (afact, none);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 23:18;0;1;8? Bitcoin has >50% with just ONE... I'd be surprised if BCH had 8.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 18:05;0;0;Don't ask me by replying to an unrelated tweet...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 17:45;0;0;This has nothing to do with the tweet you are replying to, so I am inclined to ignore and/or block.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 17:44;0;0;How are you going to vent the exhaust?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 17:15;0;3;How are you going to get the power in?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 16:25;0;3;Also can't use power or the internet within one...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 15:20;0;0;The license also does not allow you to use it with other servers, nor make any modifications whatsoever.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 15:18;0;0;Doesn't look comparable. I don't see a way to encrypt the backups.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 06:25;0;1;The service isn't the problem. The software license is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 05:51;1;9;"To be clear: 1) When I say Free Software, it's not the price that's the problem, but the [lack of] freedom; https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html … 2) I want to keep at least one copy of my backups self-hosted (I'm okay with paying for a service to host a second copy)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 05:51;1;3;Came across @ Tarsnap looking for something else.

LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 04:51;0;0;Nope;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 04:33;1;4;ETH renamed to ETC when the Ethereum corporation launched a new ETH-based altcoin under the same name/ticker.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 03:56;2;3;And no, while we do need miners (which can be anyone) in general, miners have nothing to do with rule changes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 03:56;0;2;Everyone. The only thing stopping you and I from mining right now, is the bigger miners, especially Bitmain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 03:55;0;0;Why do you guess that?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 03:52;0;2;You live in Tokyo? I'll be there this October.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 03:44;1;3;With a hardfork, there is only one currency, not two.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 02:39;0;2;I'm not. The point is that some people are misrepresenting me.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 02:37;0;0;Your bio says you are a miner. Don't you understand how difficulty works? The cost to mine increases to meet the price.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 01:26;0;0;The same reason anyone should ever invest in mining equipment: to keep the Bitcoin network secure and functioning for themselves and their counterparties.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 01:25;0;2;FUD. There is no basis for any of those claims.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 01:21;0;1;No, they don't. Changing PoW algo doesn't blow up any of the incentives either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 01:09;0;2;The point would be to avoid ugly constructs like this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 01:08;0;1;You say that as if progress is being made. It's not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 00:57;0;1;It remains an issue, and in any case, Bitmain's position in mining is already sealed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 00:57;0;0;Probably the rejection of order and duty/responsibilities.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 00:46;0;0;No, I consider libertarianism to be an error.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 00:13;0;0;Whhy?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 00:03;0;3;That's exactly what this would avoid.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2018 00:00;0;0;Just how much do these things normally cost???;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 23:52;0;0;Please. (If you can get it to make sense - it doesn't as-is IMO - feel free to make a new tweet-thread about it..);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 23:51;0;1;At least nowadays, it is prohibited to log (at least publicly) the # bitcoin channel. Not sure if it was allowed in the past, however.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 23:48;0;1;Replying to a programming tweet with a completely unrelated other topic is spam.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 23:46;0;0;I'm confused. This looks like spam I should report, but with a lightning emoji in the username?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 23:43;0;0;Go away, scammer;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 23:35;0;1;Seems fairly common to me. How many times is there a found_the_needle variable set by the loop, only to be checked immediately afterward?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 23:34;0;1;Maybe. Except you can't use && here either AFAIK. The important bit is to NOT do it if `break` is used. That way it can be used for searches (when the end of the list is reached, it means the search failed).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 23:32;0;2;I guess nobody knows it's there? It seems useful.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 23:30;0;0;That's clearly not true.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 23:29;0;0;You can't say that until you actually find persuasive evidence.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 23:29;4;16;Has anyone ever suggested allowing an `else` clause after a `for` loop, that gets executed if and only if the loop ends normally (ie, not via `break`)? # C # CPP # Programming;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 22:59;0;0;No, that's nonsense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 22:15;0;0;Judges decide based on what, though? What are they judging?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 22:02;0;0;What does common law even mean without legislation? Seems to me the former depends on the latter.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 20:17;0;0;Unfortunately, my IRC client used to mix PMs in with channel logs, and no real way to distinguish between them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 19:51;0;2;1) r/Bitcoin is not Bitcoin. 2) No evidence supporters will be banned. 3) Moderators don't control what goes on the front page (other than stickying, which is really just for exceptional posts).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 19:45;0;0;That's also a concern, but it doesn't help that Bitmain *is* a bad actor.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 19:44;0;1;CT does not require a block size increase.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 19:21;0;0;Not really.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 19:20;0;0;Might be more useful in that format, tbh.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 19:20;0;1;Seems to me, it's already proven a success, despite its relative (compared to Bitcoin) unpopularity.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 19:19;0;1;4) I'm not driving any wedge. This situation is caused entirely by Bitmain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 19:19;0;2;1) Nobody is suggesting giving up on PoW, only using a PoW algorithm that actually works. 2) EX-miners are not relevant to such decisions. 3) We can and should ignore malicious parties, including altcoiners who just want to pump their altcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 19:17;0;1;You're the one insisting on an absolute binary line.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 19:17;0;0;Depends on who those N people are and what they do.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 19:16;0;0;Bitmain is hiding it as well as is possible, and we can still tell. At the end of the day, it can't be hidden any more than this. Everyone can tell that *they're* not mining, and even the honest miners can tell they're only a small fraction of the network combined.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 19:14;0;3;The situation where we should change is already here... Many CPUs aren't a risk. There will be at least as many protecting the network.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 19:05;0;1;Only if you're economically relevant, which one person by himself never is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 18:56;4;7;ONLY if 100% of users follow it, is it a hardfork. If there is a chain split, it wasn't a hardfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 18:56;0;1;If necessary, which I don't expect it will be. The demonstrated willingness to act should create a strong incentive against re-centralising.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 18:45;0;2;Except it doesn't destroy the network, only improves its security. And the threat is empty when they call the bluff and the community is neglecting to act.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 18:42;1;2;No, it isn't. A failed hardfork attempt just becomes yet another altcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 18:30;1;3;5) Arguing the incentives will keep Bitcoin secure is a change in its security model. The Fed has incentive to keep USD secure/valuable too - why don't you just use that?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 18:24;1;3;3) The incentives are not set right since the community has been FUD'd to not change PoW (the incentive that is supposed to prevent centralisation). 4) Incentives can only be sure to work on mobs, not individual actors.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 18:23;1;3;1) Even a temporary fix is better than nothing. 2) There is a good chance that simply being willing to change PoW will fix the incentives to avoid it in the future, making it not just temporary.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 18:14;0;1;Not completely broken, but it is still broken.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 18:07;5;11;Allow? Devs don't make the rules. Hardforks MUST have consensus, or they WILL fail - this is a technical requirement, not some ideal that can be ignored.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 18:01;0;1;Not -core-dev? (-dev isn't used much anymore);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 17:18;0;0;Go look at the state of the network...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 17:07;0;0;That's already proven.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 17:07;2;5;It defeats the entire purpose of mining entirely... The whole point of PoW is to avoid anyone being able to hijack the network as Bitmain is currently able. Someone having >50% (or even >30%) breaks the security model of Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 17:01;0;0;CT cannot be a softfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 17:00;0;3;It makes no sense to hardfork for a feature addition, while not fixing a critical bug.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 16:57;0;0;The block timestamp can't overflow cleanly with the current rules.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 15:57;0;4;Mining wouldn't work at all, because it would be impossible to produce a valid block.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 15:50;0;0;If mining stops, so does Bitcoin. Has nothing to do with the subsidy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 15:49;0;3;I guess not where it is today, but probably somewhere *better*.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 15:46;2;6;Scamcoins were already around in 2013...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 03:34;0;0;They're never unchanged, and there are many factors that could influence them. Taking an average over a cherry-picked period before and after shows nothing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 02:48;0;0;Very unlikely, and has no evidence supporting it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 02:45;0;0;"Then why are you focusing on the irrelevant gun deaths"" metric?""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 02:43;0;0;Even if that were true, it would be irrelevant. Who cares if half the homicides switched from guns to other weapons?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 02:42;0;0;I am in complete agreement with that document, IIRC.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 02:41;0;0;"There is no mutual success"" between Bitcoin and scams. Scams only make Bitcoin look bad, especially when prominent people try to associate them together.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 02:39;0;2;Scammers are everywhere... never trust a webwallet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 02:38;0;0;This particular kind of censorship is a good thing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2018 02:37;0;0;Proving my point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 21:47;1;4;There are no legitimate reasons to remove children from parents. Only to remove parents from society.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 20:15;0;0;Don't. Porn should be illegal anyway.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 20:15;0;0;"Deceptive article. Starts off talking about homicides, but quickly moves into gun deaths"", and while it technically admits there's no evidence of causation, it still implies it anyway.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 20:04;0;0;Criminals can already get guns regardless of laws. Easier gun access just helps the good guys.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 18:05;0;0;"Murder is wrong, no matter how simple"" it may be. And you're wrong. Go learn biology. After conception, there is a living human being.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 17:09;0;0;My point exactly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 16:45;0;1;No, it isn't. Science is clear that abortions are murder. Fetuses are not part of the mother's body. Transplants do not support your claim (if anything, they show the opposite). Clearly you don't know what you're talking about on this subject.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 16:30;1;4;"Wait, what? after reaching a settlement agreement with the US Department of State"" - what settlement? This means no precedent was set?""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 16:30;2;11;And expanded it beyond the USA. What are anti-gun governments going to do now? A new wave of internet censorship? Ban 3D printers?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 16:19;0;1;Denying the facts won't change them. Tumours don't have their own unique DNA - they are actually part of your body, and killing them doesn't kill you.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 16:16;0;0;I don't see how. You have to interfere with others' rights before it has any effect, AIUI.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 16:15;0;0;"Is disguise"" even defined anywhere?""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 15:09;0;0;You're delusional if you think most women are as sexist as you. Regardless, murderers should be prosecuted, even if they disagree.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 15:08;0;1;"That unwanted blob of cells"" is an actual child. It's literally the same thing.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 15:08;0;0;In the case of abortion, the minority whose rights are being violated are the unborn.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 15:05;0;0;"Cardinal"" Pell was never even a priest in the first place. He is nothing but a fraud as far as the Catholic Church is concerned.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 15:03;0;0;Abortion certainly is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 15:03;0;0;After Pope Pius XII passed away, a heretic sect took over Vatican City, and there hasn't been a pope in the Catholic Church since then.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 15:02;0;0;Australia only has 1 or 2 Catholic priests TOTAL. So yes, please get sick of the frauds you've let take over your country.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 15:01;0;0;"1) Everyone's opinion"" counts, you sexist. 2) This isn't a matter of opinion anyway.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 02:05;0;0;inb4 Bitcoin turns out to be a porn-killer?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2018 00:08;0;0;Except it doesn't actually mean that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 23:32;0;1;I keep hearing about bulls and bears... but what about bacon?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 23:18;0;0;Right now, you can legally buy complete guns anonymously (at least in Florida). If the gun grabbers ban that, they can just as well ban sales of parts.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 23:13;0;0;That only can make part of a gun, sadly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 23:12;0;0;Kinda wonder how this will play out in anti-gun locales. New wave of internet censorship? Ban on 3D printers?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 23:10;0;0;My Twitter profile is explicit that I am Catholic. Also, they know in their heart that irreligion is irrational.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 23:09;0;0;I remember explicitly waiting on buying a 3D printer, until I could confirm it could print guns. Although I do recall a single-shot gun being made, I don't quite consider that sufficient.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 23:04;0;0;I don't think stock 3D printers can print guns...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 22:43;0;0;You're the misogynist, troll.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 22:40;4;16;Good luck, gun grabbers. /shttps://twitter.com/Radomysisky/status/1016740001563009025 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 22:36;0;0;Link the analysis, not the news release.https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2017.304042 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 22:25;0;0;You're the liar.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 22:25;0;0;You are the one who has no idea what he's talking about. The Catholic Church hasn't even had a pope in 60 years now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 22:17;0;0;You're projecting. P.S. I'm not even a republican.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 22:16;0;0;Go follow the links to the analysis you [rather indirectly] provided. It doesn't support your claim.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 22:03;0;0;Misogyny is the hatred of, contempt for, or prejudice against women or girls. I have no such hatred/contempt/prejudice. Murder is not health care. (Castration for actual sexual crimes is fine with me, I think.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 22:01;0;1;4) Being guilty of one crime does NOT mean you cannot speak out against other crimes. 5) Being in the same organization as a criminal does not make you guilty of his crimes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 22:01;0;0;3) Even if we include all the frauds, the rate of child rape is still lower than every other profession that works with children (and lower than every other religion, which have lower rates in general).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 22:00;0;0;1) There is no right to rape children (or anyone else for that matter). 2) For every single recent case, the accused was already NOT in communion with the Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 21:34;3;29;Twitter tells me it's # CowAppreciationDay. I sure do enjoy beef. Happy # BeefAppreciationDay.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 21:30;0;0;Nope, the data doesn't support that % either. Birth control is immoral too, but murder is the pressing issue. Only God has the right to decide who lives and dies.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 21:03;0;0;(LOL, that democrat hates the truth so much, they blocked me for simply pointing it out!);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 20:52;0;0;Also, murder isn't mere disobedience. And again, not only women commit murder (nor should women be exempt from prosecution for murder).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 19:49;3;11;Can you make it so each eye of the viewer sees the alternate? Eg, everyone's left eye sees white, and their right eye sees black.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 19:23;0;0;God isn't decentralised.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 19:23;0;0;Catholicism isn't brainwashing, it is objective truth. I came to learn that and convert through years of study.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 19:17;0;0;You may have been brainwashed, but not by the Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 19:10;0;0;When it comes to killing obviously-innocent human beings, murder is an objective fact. Suicide is also murder, and should be illegal, but in practice, there's not much the State can really do about it, and care needs to be taken to recognise mental illness.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 18:55;0;0;Murder isn't personal.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 18:47;0;0;Two different subjects.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 18:47;0;0;Decentralisation of currency is merely a means to a goal: centralised control (by you) of your own money.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 18:46;0;0;The State killing convicted criminals is not murder. Killing innocent babies, however, is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 18:38;0;1;1) Capital punishment would be better. 2) That 30% number is fabricated. 3) Murder shouldn't be safe. 4) Not only females are guilty of murder, and many females are not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 18:36;0;0;That's complete nonsense. The State's primary purpose is to protect people.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 18:36;0;0;Those aren't necessary for life. Plants don't breathe at any age.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 18:32;0;0;True, but when talking about how the system works, that isn't relevant.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 18:32;0;1;It's no different from any other murder of children. It should be prosecuted to the full extent of law.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 18:31;0;1;Yes, they do.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 18:27;0;2;You know the Constitution includes amendments, right?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 18:25;0;1;This isn't a presidential election year. Trump will be the president next year too. Midterms don't matter, because they don't change who is doing the nominating. The only offices changed by midterms, have a duty to objectively decide on the nominee, without bias.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 18:22;0;2;Abortions are never legal. The government does not have the authority to legalise murder of innocent human beings.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 18:20;0;0;"Hopefully Massachusetts will be voting no"" to your reelection.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 18:18;0;2;The people never supported abortion in the first place. Roe v Wade was nothing short of power abuse by the Supreme Court.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 18:16;0;4;"If you support the right"" to murder children, I hope you lose any election you run for.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 18:15;0;4;There is no such thing as a right to murder (aka abortion). ALL judges should be denying ALL people this heinous crime.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 18:12;0;4;It's just delusional to claim the baby isn't alive. The science is settled on this. From the moment of conception, the baby is both alive and a human being.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 13:48;0;1;First step is to get consensus on the general idea, then developers should discuss the pros/cons of available options and come up with a proposal. Then, the community either agrees to the proposal or sends it back to devs for changes. Once done, a date is scheduled to change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.07.2018 00:28;0;0;I don't think he's eligible to be president at all?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 22:16;0;0;Why just still photos for the actual consecration?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 22:05;0;0;Might be sooner and more productive to go to Mass (you can see we don't idolise Mary), and talk to a priest (who can better answer your questions) afterward. Looks like July 22nd is the next Mass in London:http://tridentinemasssociety.co.uk/mass-schedule-2018/ …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 18:45;0;2;If a third party couldn't win against Clinton v Trump, they will never win unless the election system gets changed significantly. Like it or not, there are only two parties now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 16:11;0;0;The problem isn't the carriers - we have like 3 or 4 options in that regard - but that http://Healthcare.gov won't allow me specifically to sign up for any because it thinks we should be on Medicaid (which we don't actually qualify for in practice).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 15:26;0;0;All of these groups require a declaration of faith of some sort.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 15:25;0;1;Sortof. They based it on the size (area) of the cut. Don't have to be a MD to know that's not enough to rule out infection.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 15:23;0;0;Didn't find any. FWIW, our largest city has a population under 8000.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 15:19;0;0;"The contraception thing was just an easy way to demonstrate that there aren't nearly as many Catholics as there are Catholics""-in-name-only.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 15:14;0;0;But after seeking advice from the bishop on that matter, the understanding I came away with was that I couldn't, because they are a non-Catholic religious organization, and despite that I could in good conscience agree to their membership requirements.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 15:13;0;0;When I was looking for life insurance, I thought it might be most cost-effective to join the Knights of Columbus temporarily just to get a life insurance policy through them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 15:11;0;0;"At least 98% of self-described Catholics"" practice birth control, despite Catholicism teaching that it is damning. Clearly, not all ""Catholics"" are Catholic.""";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 15:00;0;1;1) It was an emergency, or I wouldn't have taken him there. 2) There is no such thing as a public hospital here? Or how is this being defined?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 14:30;0;0;I don't know what you mean. Stating something you know to be false is not okay.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 14:29;0;0;Yes, I don't do employment, just contract work...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 14:12;0;0;Isn't http://Healthcare.gov a federal thing?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 13:54;0;0;As of last November, we are prevented from buying insurance. I see no reason to hope this November will let us buy it again.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 13:41;0;0;I don't expect anything to change from last Nov (when I first encountered the problem).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 13:31;0;0;Except the marketplace blocks us from buying anything...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 13:30;0;0;Prevented by the government. We had private insurance through http://Healthcare.gov , but they cut us off and forced us to apply for Medicaid instead (which we don't qualify for). Now we can't even buy insurance.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 12:35;0;0;BCBS is what we had before the government forced us off it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 12:27;0;0;http://Healthcare.gov won't allow us to buy insurance anymore.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 12:27;0;0;We had private insurance. http://Healthcare.gov forced us off of it and wouldn't let us buy private insurance anymore - instead, it forced us to apply for Medicaid. Medicaid says we're not eligible. At this point, there is no plan to make changes to. We have been cut off.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 12:22;0;0;Except I make too much to qualify for Medicaid, it seems. I'm not poor - I can afford to self-pay.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 12:20;0;1;Spoilers!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 12:09;0;0;We can revisit it once the bigger issues are dealt with.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 11:46;0;0;Frankly, healthcare stuff is so far down my list of concerns, I'd be perfectly happy with using a one-payer model as a bargaining chip.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 11:18;0;0;LOL;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 11:00;0;2;Hmm, how do you mean? Is there a way to ensure the ER pays for it instead? Had to take my son to an ER some months ago. They refused to treat him, and still had the audacity to bill me. Not paying that, hope nobody else does either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 10:52;0;1;It would be nice, but unfortunately, ACA has prevented me from having healthcare entirely. I can't even buy it with my own money anymore.https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1015956727773257728 …;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 10:45;0;0;But they're protestant groups. Pretty sure that as a Catholic, I can't join them (they might be willing to accept me, but Catholics don't join non-Catholic religious organizations).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 10:44;0;2;Lying is not acceptable for any reason.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 10:42;0;0;Yes, they're basically all protestant or otherwise problematic.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 10:41;0;0;They seem to require a Statement of Beliefs, which in itself might be problematic, but certainly is in this case since theirs includes heresy. I couldn't agree to this. Additionally, I would want to be sure I couldn't be compelled to fund murder, which I don't see any assurance.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 10:35;0;1;It's either a fact or a falsehood. It certainly isn't an opinion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 10:30;0;0;I don't get why people seem to trust big corporations not to put malware in their websites...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 10:29;0;1;BCH didn't exist until 2017, so it can't be his father.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 10:26;0;1;So fewer people have insurance now? How does that support your claim?!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2018 10:25;0;0;As with any sin, we are only culpable of it if we wilfully make a choice. Baptism is also required, but a catechumen who dies prior to receiving it is also not guilty of not being baptised.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 20:05;0;0;Better than our current system.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 20:04;0;0;Maybe other doctrines, but not this one. But the Bible was never meant to be taken alone. God established a Church for teaching His doctrine instead.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 19:43;0;5;Why not?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 19:24;0;4;Fine. Why does it need to hurt me to help them?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 19:23;0;0;Just stop for a moment and ponder how ridiculous it is to pick one quote out of context. Go read the entire John chapter 6.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 19:15;1;13;What were the other 27 thinking, going out in public unarmed?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:56;0;0;Catholics don't worship Mary as an idol. He certainly did teach transubstantiation, and in no uncertain terms! When people stopped following Him over it, He re-enforced the doctrine as literal.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:55;1;2;I can afford insurance. The problem is the government preventing me from buying it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:54;1;4;That is one law I would have no problems ignoring. Unfortunately, I can't force the doctor to keep us as patients.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:54;0;0;I came to the truth by studying, not brainwashing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:53;0;0;So let me buy insurance. For those who can't afford it, that's why we have charitable organizations. And worst case, they can just decline to pay - the law requires giving them medical care regardless.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:51;0;0;God makes those decisions. He obviously disagrees with you. And God is always right.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:49;0;0;You seem like a troll, so just gonna block...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:48;0;0;The market doesn't allow me to buy it. It forces me to apply for Medicaid instead (which then denies me as ineligible).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:47;0;1;What? This was all setup by Obama. At least with the Republicans, the fine will apparently be going away.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:46;0;2;As things are, I can't get them covered at all, despite being able to pay for it!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:45;0;5;I do. The problem is the government won't let me spend my money on health insurance.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:43;0;0;That's simply not true. The coverups were by a non-Catholic/heretic sect, already condemned by the Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:43;0;0;Yes, there was. Jesus established the Catholic Church before His Ascension.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:42;0;0;As I understand it, even if I can agree to their profession, because they are a non-Catholic religious organization, it wouldn't be acceptable to join. (At least, that was the answer I got regarding joining the Knights of Columbus strictly to buy life insurance.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:41;0;0;I can afford it, but the government is now blocking me from buying it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:40;0;0;I didn't see any way to apply for such a thing on that website?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:39;0;0;Depends on what the insurance covers. Personally, I'd probably rather just self-insure, but ACA doesn't really allow that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:37;0;0;Not from what I've seen... (I looked into what a certain small business I used to do regular work for would have to pay to put me on insurance, and it was more than what I had to pay.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:35;0;0;Facts and truth are the same thing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:34;0;0;Nope, they're the same.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:30;0;0;Wow, that's insane!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:30;0;2;Why not? And why do you care? Unless you're eligible for Medicaid (which does NOT depend on the ACA), it's usually cheaper to self-pay anyway.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 18:29;1;7;Children are a gift from God. Nothing irresponsible about them. I can provide for my family. I blame the government for *interfering* in me doing so.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 16:07;0;1;Nothing happens unless it is God's plan. We have free will, not free action.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 16:07;0;1;Only grandfathered services were exempted by the ACA, and there weren't any Catholic ones before it passed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 16:05;0;0;IIRC it was around $1k/mo for the private insurance - but that covered basically nothing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 16:00;0;12;Hopefully repealing or replacing it is also part of God's plan.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 15:57;1;27;Oh, and while the Medicaid was pending, we found out that if we had Medicaid, our family doctor would have been forbidden by law to provide us with services, even if we self-paid for them...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 15:53;1;30;(And to make it worse, we're forced to pay absurd fines to the IRS for not having the insurance we were prevented from buying!);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 05:20;0;1;False religions are not comparable to the true religion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 05:20;0;0;It's well-defined. A Catholic is someone who assents to 100% of the Catholic religion, and submits to the Roman Pontiffs at least in principle.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 04:06;0;0;Yes, they should. Because God's law really is above the Constitution, even if evil men deny it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 04:06;0;0;Nope. When the pilot tells you you're at a given altitude, do you go up front and demand he prove it? Stating facts does not create any such responsibility, and if you applied that standard equally, you'd never get anything done.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2018 03:57;0;1;Not sure a real Catholic would have any *chance* of getting such an office. They'll never approve someone who admits that God's law is above the Constitution.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.07.2018 22:46;0;0;I haven't seen any yet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.07.2018 12:50;0;0;Sure I can. How can you know 1+1=2 without considering all other possible answers?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.07.2018 12:48;0;1;Probably. I don't know for sure if such a law would be just or not, but it would be imprudent to continue in this line of work if it jeopardized my family.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.07.2018 19:19;0;0;Where's the argument?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2018 19:17;0;0;Free will, yes. Not free action. Certainly not free action without consequences.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.07.2018 19:03;0;0;If it harms society, and the government has jurisdiction (ie, it doesn't violate any natural rights), it is justified to make a law prohibiting it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 11:48;0;0;Abortion is moral law, not civil nor religious. No human authority can allow killing innocents. As Jesus left it, the States were morally obliged to be subject to the Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 11:47;0;0;Easier to skip Judaism, I think. http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608b.htm#IB …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 11:44;0;0;God does not give the State authority to kill innocent people.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 11:43;0;0;Yes, Jesus/God came miraculously on Earth and gave authority over civil laws to the individual States, and authority over the religious laws to the Catholic Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 11:35;0;0;God made various dietary rules because man did not yet have the capacity to prepare the food safely. If my understanding on His reasoning is wrong, that doesn't matter, since He abolished those laws anyway.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 11:34;0;0;1) Twitter is a terrible forum for proofs. 2) Proving God's attributes would take longer than I have time (not my job to convince you, sorry) 3) Sorry to hear about your child. 4) Only the government possesses authority to kill criminals.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 11:32;0;0;God can't be proven in one big swoop. First, you prove He exists at all (easy), then you prove the details piece-by-piece (not so easy). Eventually, you end up with Catholicism.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 11:31;0;0;Already went over that. The moment of conception is when a living human being with distinct DNA from the mother first exists.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 11:27;0;0;The moral law does not change. The divine positive law can. Civil laws (which God once controlled for ancient Israel) can. Church laws can.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 11:21;0;0;Well, you're correct that abortion was never legal anywhere else either. But some laws of God (not abortion) DO change. Governments can give any punishment they want for idol-worship.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 11:16;0;0;In the USA, which is the context of this discussion. I don't care for pork, but bacon is delicious. Cheeseburgers are yummy too. (Glad those laws actually changed.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 11:15;0;0;1) It's not an opinion. 2) God is proven.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 11:12;0;1;Please. Blocking is nothing compared to murder. I regularly block trolls (and liberally unblock people who promise to behave like a decent human being, at least on Twitter).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 11:10;0;0;Abortion was never legal in the first place, merely went un-prosecuted so people have been getting away with it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 11:09;0;1;I'm not sure this can really be attributed to Catholicism, as much as it is her being a heath nut.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 11:08;0;0;Human beings only come into existence when God acts to cause it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 10:56;0;0;You're the troll.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 10:52;0;0;Not irrelevant. Catholicism never changes.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 09:45;0;0;No, it isn't called abortion by anyone sane. And condoms should be illegal (to a practical extent, anyway) too. Go away, dishonest troll.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 09:43;0;0;When you start murdering children, it is everyone's business.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 09:36;0;0;Few things, perhaps, can be proven with absolute certainty, but God's existence is one of them.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 06:17;0;0;When it comes to government and courts, it IS their job to judge.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 06:16;0;0;It includes anyone guilty of it. So certainly the abortionist who kills the child directly (murder for hire), but also whoever knowingly commissioned such murders. Often that includes the father, unfortunately. Sometimes it doesn't include the mother either.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 05:44;0;0;They are not baptised, and have no capacity to desire baptism. Bottom line is that abortion is murder, and those guilty of it should be put on trial and sentenced just like any other murderer.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 05:43;0;0;"The courts simply refused to convict people guilty of murdering unborn children, and the prosecutors stopped trying.

LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 04:29;0;0;You are both your body AND your spirit. And abortion victims don't go to Heaven, so that's not a good thing. Even if they did, it would still not justify murder.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 04:18;0;1;Irrelevant.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 04:18;0;1;English?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 04:17;0;0;Not everyone who received an abortion is culpable of the crime. Many were tricked or even forced into it. Note that abortion was never actually legal. Courts and prosecutors just refused to prosecute it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 04:16;0;0;You shut up, idiot.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 04:15;0;0;Not the mother's body either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 04:15;0;0;You are delusional. Science proves they are indeed children.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 04:12;0;0;No, trolling.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 04:12;0;0;Go away troll, you know nothing about me. Men are no less relevant than women. Both are being murdered in the womb.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 04:11;0;0;That's one of the things we know by God's positive revelation. So first, you need to show that the Catholic Church's teachings are guaranteed to have been revealed by God.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 04:09;0;0;God is real and Catholicism is provable. Delusional denial of them are no excuse for crime.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 04:09;0;0;No, it doesn't. Murder is always immoral objectively for everyone.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 01:58;0;0;Killing is not the same as creation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 01:57;0;0;Now you're just trolling.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 01:56;0;0;Sperm + egg do not alone create human life. For a new human life to come into existence requires a positive act by God, to create the soul. Pregnancy and motherhood are not trauma.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 01:53;0;0;But this has nothing to do with culture.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 01:52;0;0;Catholicism deals in facts. It's not like the countless false religions out there - there's no comparison.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 01:51;0;0;Again, even if such conditions existed, it wouldn't matter. Murder is still immoral.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 01:47;0;0;The moral fact is that killing a human being is an exclusive right of God. Science is good for discovering unknown truths, but this one we know from God (Truth) Himself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 01:46;0;0;The father has a duty to provide for his family. It is very unfortunate that many men force (at least in practice) their wives to work outside the home (if they want to, that's one thing, but they shouldn't *have to*).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 01:43;0;0;Then give us a Democrat who is pro-life, and we can work on both issues in parallel. Until then, the priority needs to be the millions being outright murdered.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 01:39;0;0;Proving Catholicism true from scratch is way too much for Twitter, and I don't have time to go over it regardless. But it can be done.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 01:30;0;0;Yes, that's an issue. Trump isn't perfect. Once we have secured their right to life in the first place, we can move on to worrying about quality of life.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 01:29;0;0;Certain facts are established, and it makes little sense to entertain delusions that they are not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 01:28;0;0;Yes, and Catholicism can be proven true.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.07.2018 01:23;0;0;There aren't such conditions, but even if there were, it wouldn't make it moral.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.06.2018 04:44;0;1;Bitmain themselves also have corrupt incentives because of BCH. As soon as it's reduced to single entity (or even a small group), you simply cannot assume or enforce a specific incentive. At that point, the entity/group can manipulate or ignore incentives.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2018 04:43;0;1;Waiting until harm has been done is NOT how you handle an exploit. When an exploit is found, it is supposed to be fixed immediately.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2018 04:42;0;0;Sorry, I don't see how it's different. How is mining decentralisation any less of a parameter than the supply limit? It's the same thing, from both a technical AND ideological perspective.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2018 04:40;0;2;After we have consensus to make a PoW change, the honest manufacturers would disclose their secret algorithm (one of them, if they have multiple) to developers and eventually publicly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2018 02:27;0;0;PoW change is nothing more or less than correcting an exploit.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2018 02:17;0;1;By that logic, we should not have fixed ANY bugs, and were wrong to disenfranchise that guy in 2010 who got 184 billion BTC simply playing by the rules. Not only is your argument stupid, but that ship has long sailed...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.06.2018 02:06;0;0;Which is exactly why Segwit BIPs were not promoted to Final status until 3 months after BCH launched and failed to get community support (the criteria defined in BIP 2).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2018 01:55;0;0;"It can. If Segwit was something to oppose, the community would create a no confidence"" hardfork if the miners tried to impose it. It would probably look a lot like BCH, except with the community adopting it instead of some niche.""";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.06.2018 01:01;0;0;Not so long as those competitors followed the recommended best practices that have been around since 2012...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2018 01:00;0;0;ASICs are fine. Bitmain has no advantage over anyone else with a good PoW. If we eventually end up in the same situation again, that's not terrible. We can just change again until we have a long-term solution. It's still better to solve it for the short term than do nothing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2018 00:49;0;0;Denying the problem is just delusional trolling.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2018 00:48;0;1;With option 1, no action is taken until an attack has been performed, which implies that in such a scenario, people have lost their (confirmed!) bitcoins, usage has had to stop entirely (probably for days), etc. Even if confidence was restored, price would certainly take a hit.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.06.2018 23:30;0;0;Trying to heal itself, maybe, but there's no positive reason to even hope for, much less expect, a successful outcome to that.

LukeDashjr;29.06.2018 22:42;0;0;At least *that* proposal would have a net effect of no change. So few people would make helper blocks (remember, only 1 person is chosen per block) that it wouldn't be worth the effort for miners to implement it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.06.2018 22:35;0;3;I would say that's true... The only reason it was acceptable is because the change had no adverse impact on those people.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.06.2018 22:29;0;1;America DID have laws against abortion before those 7 people decided to overrule them.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.06.2018 22:22;0;0;That's not the government's primary job. Their role is to prosecute crime.

LukeDashjr;29.06.2018 03:33;0;0;No, morality is objective. People deluding themselves with erroneous ideas of morality do not change reality, and must be held to the correct standards despite their false notions.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.06.2018 03:32;0;1;It has already been proven to be the moment of conception.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.06.2018 03:31;0;0;There should be, but there aren't right now. Maybe in a few elections, we can have the right to life secured and can move on to other, less pressing, issues.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.06.2018 00:49;0;0;It's already justifiable to kill someone trying to rape you, if that's what you need to do to prevent the crime. But that's not because of a possible child, simply self-defense.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.06.2018 00:39;0;0;Immoral actions are not legitimate means to prevent it. If you have no legitimate way to stop it, it's not negligence.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 23:41;0;0;Death isn't evil. Killing an innocent person is. If the only way to stop two accidental deaths is to commit murder, you still cannot commit murder.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 23:40;0;0;People aren't products. You don't have a right to evict your children until age 18, even if you don't want them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 23:29;0;0;Ends cannot justify an evil means.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 23:19;0;0;No, you don't have any right to evict your children until they are 18. You would be laughed out of court at best.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 23:02;0;0;Indeed, the act is inherently evil regardless of terminology. That's my point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 23:01;0;0;That doesn't follow. Just because it's your car doesn't mean you have a right to drive it into a supermarket ignoring the damage it will do it others.

LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 22:59;0;0;No, interfering with private property is not the correct approach. The goal shouldn't be to starve PP of funding, but to prosecute PP and shut it down entirely.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 22:58;0;1;Go for it. But without God, there is no such things as morality at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 22:57;0;0;Gavin was already uninvolved at that point.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 22:33;0;1;Such laws existed when people did indeed vote on them. It took power abuse by an oligarchy of 7 men to overrule the democratic outcome.

LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 22:22;0;4;At least the vast majority, yes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 22:22;0;0;It's your tweets that reflect a large ignorance of reality, not mine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 22:21;0;0;I'm not so sure. The stupid seem perfectly capable of using birth control in general. It's also possible for people to be both stupid *and* moral.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 22:19;0;0;A human child has been specially created by God. An animal is merely the product of biology. But more importantly, God has given man dominion over the animals, and the right to kill them. The right to kill humans, however, He has reserved to Himself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 22:18;0;1;3) No action can be taken by *anyone* (clergy or not) unless God permits it. But God only tolerates evil when He can bring good from it, and such toleration does not equate to a command to do it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 22:10;0;1;Firearms are the minimum tool necessary to give the victim of an assault a reasonable chance to prevail against an attacker. As such, it is a fundamental human right, and any attempt to ban firearms is inherently a criminal action.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 16:18;0;0;Then you deny objective reality, as proven by science.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 16:18;0;0;Because it objectively is murder.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 16:16;0;0;I never said that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 16:15;0;0;My point is that they were always condemned.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 16:14;0;0;In that case, they may possibly be unaware of the heresies of V2 and the Modernists, and being unaware of that, legitimately justified in believing Francis to be a pope. Perhaps they have even retained ordinary jurisdiction?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 16:13;0;0;It sounds like Pope Pius XII gave the Chinese bishops permission to consecrate without mandate (similar to Bp.

LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 16:03;0;0;It's not even an analogy. It's literally the same thing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 16:02;0;1;Babies don't develop in the vagina, you know... and the Bible isn't God.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 16:02;0;0;No, it doesn't. Neither does self-awareness.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 16:01;0;1;Not really. Birth control in general is immoral (with or without murder), and basically everyone acknowledged that fact until the 20th century, so why would people around the early ADs bother going into detail about when life begins and such?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 15:55;0;1;This isn't Caesar's, though. It's God's. Therefore, to render it unto Caesar would be IDOLATRY.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 15:48;0;1;As far as I know, they *already* prosecute murders of children who have already been born. It's only when the victim is unborn that people have been getting away with murder.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 15:46;0;0;For example, murder of unborn children was rare prior to the Supreme Court suspending prosecution of it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 15:05;0;0;Because it's not solvable at this time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 15:04;0;0;Except that the attacking miner can just ignore your second algo, and all the old nodes will consider its chain to be better.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:52;0;0;If the parents won't do it, society has to step up.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:50;0;0;The unborn need it more, but yes, of course we do fight for both.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:49;0;1;Yes, I did.https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1012270653121204225 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:46;0;0;A is completely insecure. Eventually B would become more or less equally insecure, but at no point would A be *more* secure (at least not so long as we're only talking about hashrates).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:44;0;0;Keep in mind even when they place children with family members, the parents still need to pay child support to the government, plus they still the usual federal funds.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:43;0;0;I've personally seen it happen to people far too many times. Senator Nancy Schaefer also documented and called them out on it (and was then murdered). There may be exceptions, but the system overall is very corrupt.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:40;0;0;Darrel Castle (Constitution Party) perhaps. But America's election system is a lost cause, it would seem.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:39;0;0;Definitely B.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:38;0;0;Next step is to retroactively prosecute and execute everyone guilty of such murders. If they're dead, they can't be aiming any cross-hairs at the good judges anymore.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:36;0;0;Apparently so. I had no reason to believe him during his election campaign though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:35;0;0;Pretty sure I already explained to you why this is nonsense...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:34;0;0;Also, it isn't actually that underfunded. A huge part of the problem is that CPS is regularly kidnapping children from *good* parents, and putting them into the system. That needs to stop too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:33;1;0;Quite a few countries, can each individually kill Bitcoin if they so desired.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:32;0;0;Caring for their children is the responsibility of the parents. If they won't do their duty, then society will have to compensate (while locking them up in prison until they're willing to get with it), but it is entirely unreasonable to demand we just take care of all kids.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:29;0;0;It's not even true in the first place. Religious people provide a lot of charity toward the needy living. It's also a terrible comparison, since the living aren't being intentionally slaughtered.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:28;0;1;No, but given the current situation, I'd rather not explain why not (ie, how Bitmain could attack Lightning effectively).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:26;0;0;Quite a few do.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:26;0;0;Centralised hashrate does not provide security, so they would have the same problems Bitcoin has now. Price is not based on hashrate, so that's unrelated.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:25;0;0;What's your point? I am against abortion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:24;0;0;I didn't say ban. I said kill.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:23;0;1;Most miners only care about profits, and mining Bitcoin is the obvious most profitable coin to mine. So yes. Not to mention that there's a LOT of Bitcoin users, many of whom have GPUs of their own, who would love to mine given the opportunity.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:21;0;1;Except that's not going to happen, and it's absurd to even suggest it's a possibility.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:20;0;0;The Chinese gov could kill Bitcoin easily if they want to.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:19;0;0;Probably they would start mining BCH. BCH worships miners, so they probably will never care to fix the PoW centralisation issue.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:18;0;0;Found the strawman!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:17;0;0;Is that a strawman, a whataboutism, or both combined?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:15;0;2;PoW change is *probably better*, but worst case *returns to how we are now*. There's very little, if any, chance that it would make things *worse*.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:13;0;0;I'm not sure I understand your tweet. (I was hoping for a Constitution Party victory, not Democrat. Figured Clinton v. Trump would make a third party win possible. Sorely disappointed at that still.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 14:10;0;0;Irrelevant. It only addresses pool centralisation, which is no longer the primary issue.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 13:08;0;9;Your whataboutism is basically saying we shouldn't act to prevent 60 million more intentional murders unless we first stop a few hundred accidental deaths. It's absurdity. I never said any kids' lives weren't important.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 13:06;1;2;CT is a feature. PoW change is a critical bugfix. It would make no sense to hardfork for a feature, and NOT fix the critical bug.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 13:02;0;0;ZK proving would be an interesting PoW algorithm from this perspective (although I fear it contradicts the main goals of a PoW change today).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 13:00;0;0;SHA2 is no longer a simple algo. That's part of the problem.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 13:00;1;6;No CT without PoW change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:46;0;1;Right. The former has been recommended to manufacturers since before any SHA2 ASICs ever existed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:44;0;1;Those details depend on the specific PoW change performed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:43;3;7;Yes, but to actually get to 2146, we will require a hardfork at least one more time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:39;0;2;In that case, you are simply wrong. After a PoW change, there will be *more* miners under diverse control.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:38;0;0;The child is not attacking at all. It is murder.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:37;0;0;Asking for proof of this isn't reasonable. Rather, you should be asking, how can it be proven they *don't*? Don't trust. Verify. That being said, there is plenty of observable evidence Bitmain does control over 50%:https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1005996403288616960 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:36;0;1;This isn't about pools. Bitmain controls over 50% of the hardware directly.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:34;0;0;"It would allow us to switch to HalongSHA2 or CanaanSHA2"", cutting out Bitmain, while keeping at least some of the honest miners.

LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:31;6;19;y2k38 is an issue for timestamps using a 31-bit (eg, signed 32-bit) number of seconds since epoch. Bitcoin uses 32-bit timestamps. That gives us until the year 2106. It can't be fixed with a softfork, only accelerated. That is, we could make Bitcoin freeze any time BEFORE 2106.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:29;0;0;That's not very important at all, and better to be left for the last minute to decide on.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:28;0;0;Mining pools don't even need to be involved. Bitmain has physical or legal control over >50% themselves.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:27;0;1;"It makes no sense to say hashrate drops"". You can't even *compare* hashrates of different algorithms. And there's basically nothing mining hardware can do that would make Bitcoin vulnerable.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:26;0;0;Bitmain *are* the physical owners of more than 50%.... That's exactly the problem. We're long past pools being the issue here.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:25;0;0;Are you serious?? There is only one truth. Anything else is delusion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:25;0;0;No, being the victim of rape does not entitle you to commit murder. If someone comes for my wife, I (or she) will kill him before he gets anywhere near impregnating her.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:23;0;2;Of course. Make blocks invalid at an earlier timestamp.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:23;0;0;"In this case, the alternative algorithms would simply be undocumented variants of the original one, chosen by the manufacturer (eg, Halong-variant SHA2"" or ""Canaan-variant SHA2""). They would mostly use the same circuits as the regular SHA2, just slightly different.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:18;0;1;This isn't about women's health. It's about (both male and female) childrens' lives. Re Scripture: you're misinterpreting it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:16;2;13;It's 2106, not 2038. But we could move it forward with a softfork...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:15;0;0;FPGAs are just complex ASICs. They simply have lots of gates for configuration. But to merely support a backup PoW algorithm (or a few) is only a small number of gates, and wouldn't significantly impact performance, efficiency, nor cost.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:13;0;0;It is quite trivial. The *only* difficulty, is getting consensus to make the change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:12;1;11;Of course not. Animals are just animals, not humans. I know from experience that raising kids does NOT cost lots of money. But I also agree our economy sucks, and we should work on solving that in parallel. The income from just one parent should be made sufficient to provide.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:10;0;0;More like switching to a new chat program. If a better one comes out, you can switch to that. If the one you used before improves, you can switch back. Just common sense, really.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:09;0;0;It would actually be a huge step forward. While ASICs are generally better than CPU/GPU/FPGA, centralisation kills any and all benefit since it eliminates the very purpose miners serve.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:07;0;0;It pretty much is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:07;0;0;Even in the worst-case scenario where the good manufacturers may have neglected to do so this time around (which wouldn't make sense, since it's basically free to do), it's a lot less likely the second round of ASICs, after a PoW change, would neglect it again.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:05;0;0;Everyone making ASICs was recommended from the start to have a few extra gates so if a PoW change is needed, the community can arrange to have their miners continue functioning. Assuming they good manufacturers have done so, their customers could keep mining after the change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:04;0;0;Nope.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:03;0;0;If SHA256 improves in the future, we can always switch back.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:03;0;2;The speculation is the claim that Bitmain *would* rapidly regain their monopoly. There's a *chance* of that, admittedly, but even in that worst-case scenario, we just end up back where we are now, and can repeat the PoW change again.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:02;0;0;"Majority hashrate"" has no meaning when you're comparing two different algorithms. Furthermore, it is irrelevant even with the same algorithm. What do you mean ""recover""? Bitcoin would immediately be more secure after a change, than it is now.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:01;0;0;They don't necessarily need to buy new hardware.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 12:00;0;0;I doubt it. But if they did, we'd be in no worse a situation than we currently are.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:59;0;0;Not in any meaningful sense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:58;0;0;We've always been wide open for State attackers. More today on SHA2 than ever before, in fact.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:57;0;0;They did... (maybe not all, but a large amount);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:57;1;1;That was implied by saying Bitcoin not being secure doesn't matter.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:56;0;0;If Bitmain breaks the new algorithm, we can change again, and again, until we find one that holds up to attack.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:56;0;0;The current competitors are less of a threat to Bitmain than the former competitors back years ago before Bitmain broke SHA2.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:54;0;1;It is at the moment of conception, that the sperm and egg combine to form a new unique and complete human DNA, as an independent living being from his mother. From there, the baby merely develops continuously, the same as he continues to develop after birth and into adulthood.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:52;0;1;Catholicism simply teaches that all humans have a soul. Not particularly relevant to the topic. What we have learned from science, on the other hand, is that conception is when a living human being comes into existence.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:50;0;1;Except it's not a FUD campaign. It's a campaign based on facts.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:48;0;0;And if Bitmain favours BCH (which they do), they may very well believe that could work in their favour. (Whether it actually does or not is irrelevant - they will act on whether they think it does, and can manipulate things to make it more probable.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:46;0;1;sigh, more FUD.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:45;0;0;If Bitcoin isn't secure, why use it instead of PayPal or some other centralised system?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:45;0;2;The *reason* Bitcoin is less profitable in comparison, is because 1) their GPUs *can't* mine Bitcoin, so they have to choose something else, 2) Bitmain's centralisation compromises the ability for others to profit mining Bitcoin, 3) probably other things that aren't as obvious;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:43;0;1;It would be harder to 51% attack than the current situation is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:42;0;0;They *don't* become smaller in that scenario, though. If everything stops progressing, the current miner-set is simply solidified in place as-is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:41;0;0;All the honest miners would net benefit from a PoW change too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:41;0;0;Not at all. The opposite doesn't even make sense: they can't *gain* something (an advantage) when they already have it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:40;0;0;Again, I'm not talking about mining pools. I'm talking about physical and legal control of the hardware.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2018 11:39;0;0;No, abortion is never morally acceptable for ANY reason. No exceptions. It is completely unjustifiable to punish a child for the crimes of his father.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.06.2018 23:08;0;0;It doesn't make a difference, though. It's the same crime of murder, that the State has no authority to allow.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2018 23:07;0;0;No. Government has authority from God to take the lives of certain criminals convicted through due process. Totally different situation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2018 23:06;0;0;Courts have no say over rights. The Supreme Court abused power in Roe v. Wade. P.S. Roe wasn't even pregnant, so there was no father...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2018 23:03;0;1;"Everything that happens (including ones circumstances) is by Divine providence. It doesn't really make sense to try to separate them.

LukeDashjr;24.06.2018 22:56;0;1;Actually, it is very related. The few who receive a good upbringing (or even partially good), receive it by the grace of God, and cannot claim credit for it either.

LukeDashjr;24.06.2018 22:52;0;0;Fathers already have a duty to raise their children, and laws already reflect that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2018 22:51;0;0;One is only a Catholic if they adhere to 100% of Catholic doctrine (although perhaps not practice, which is probably what you meant).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2018 22:50;0;0;It is objectively murder.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2018 22:50;0;2;Nope. Catholicism is not consensus-based nor democratic. It cannot be changed under any circumstances.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2018 22:48;0;0;What silence? The Church has made it perfectly clear where it stands on parental rights. (Your example isn't even a good one, since these moms are criminals. A better example would be the numerous good parents who have their children kidnapped by CPS.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2018 21:52;0;0;You are not correct.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2018 21:51;0;0;The responsibility for raising children is entirely the parents'. The State has no business meddling, nor being expected to provide for the child. The State's job is to prosecute criminals, including those who murder. Doing its job does imply it should take on the parents' job.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.06.2018 08:23;0;2;No, both softforks and hardforks are software upgrades. Hardforks require consensus more than softforks do. When you're creating an entirely new blockchain, that's simply an altcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.06.2018 08:05;0;1;No, it's just an altcoin. A hardfork would mean Bitcoin itself changed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.06.2018 08:05;0;0;That just makes it harder to deal with when someone is trying to sabotage the network with false alerts. You can't ban Tor nodes.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 20:02;0;0;None would have an upper hand. That's the whole point of a PoW change...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 19:51;0;0;That's why there is no PoW change today.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 19:50;0;0;Nobody is suggesting abandoning PoW.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 19:49;0;0;"That's simply not true. You can't even *compare* different algorithms' hashrates. Furthermore, centralised hashrate is worthless. PoW change only improves the network; it doesn't compromise it.";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 19:30;0;0;Indeed, but it does seem to support Cobra's point. For a PoW change to happen, we need not only a majority anyway, but consensus (~100%).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 19:26;0;0;Yes. The State is obliged to recognise the true religion, and base its laws on proper morals. Without that, you end up with government forming its own de facto false religion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 19:24;0;1;Centralised hashpower is worthless, and miners don't provide the value behind the cryptocurrency.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 19:17;0;1;Not really. Current results seem to be: 37% anti-hardfork 38% support PoW change 25% HFs okay, but NO PoW change;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 07:15;0;0;Marriage is a PUBLIC covenant between a man, a woman, and God. It is inherently public, since it is for the purpose of procreation, which extends society. Priests are expected to witness as a representative of the Church, and both the Church and the State may regulate it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 07:14;0;3;Killing BCH would not mitigate risk. I'd rather keep BCH around so our good miners can get *some* return on their costs after we PoW change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 06:53;0;1;They decide what their backup algos are. Then the community decides to support them in the PoW change (or not).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 06:48;0;0;That would be the crime of rape, which puts the perpetrator(s) in jail. If the child has no parent to care for them, the foster care and adoption systems come into play. At no point is there any need for CPS.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 06:47;0;0;Welcome to 2018. A flaw WAS discovered a long while ago, and a PoW change DOES let more people make ASICs...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 06:45;0;0;Where is that in law? I've certainly never seen it in anything I signed (including my marriage license). It's also not the Catholic position on it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 06:45;0;0;"Nah. 1) The goal is many manufacturers, who can compete against each other; 2) The reality that we are prepared to PoW change again creates a strong incentive for manfuacturers to play nice. That's not benevolence; it's properly-ordered incentives. :)";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 06:36;0;1;I've never seen a marriage license that gives jurisdiction to divorce or family courts. I'd be surprised if, in the right circumstances, a Catholic priest wouldn't consent to witness a marriage without a license.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 06:35;0;0;Even 1 company making ASICs is sufficient, so long as they distribute them widely and don't hoard them for themselves. Although obviously, the more the better to prevent this from happening. Cost of a 51% attack would be higher after switching, since it is centralised right now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 06:34;0;3;Now think about how much money they might think they'll make by killing Bitcoin in favour of BCH...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 06:33;0;2;Not likely. Certainly not moreso. Worst case, we'd be back to where we are today.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 06:32;0;0;No, because consensus would entail the current Bitcoin losing all its value, and then you have no currency to settle in.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 06:29;1;6;You can't know their incentives.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 06:29;0;0;Probably not, but we've shared PoW algos with other coins before anyway. (Likely some coins will follow us after the switch.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 06:26;0;1;(ie, none of the problems are with the PoW change itself.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 06:26;0;1;Just the usual issues of coordinating a hardfork, and afterward, we'd probably need to go back to decentralising pools.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 05:56;0;5;1) I'm not aware of a well-defined spec. 2) BDPL is problematic, and not really usable. I'm not aware of any effort to fix it. 3) AsicBoost is still complex regardless. 4) Bitmain has already locked in their advantage for SHA2.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 05:52;0;1;Ex-miners don't necessarily have any economic influence...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 05:51;0;0;Quite a large amount of the community seems to have been FUD'd into thinking PoW change = bad, so this is a strong economic opposition.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 05:50;0;0;For consensus, it's easy: anyone who wishes to object, must do so publcly in a well-reasoned or at least economically-backed manner.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 05:50;0;1;It's not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 05:46;0;4;No, it used to be a simple design. AsicBoost completely changed that.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 05:43;1;3;PoW change *is* the market mitigating the problem.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 05:41;1;2;Then you don't understand the first thing about Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 05:38;0;0;Nope;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 05:36;0;0;The problem with NYA was a few people trying to decide for everyone else. This is fixed by (ideally, reliably) polling the community as a whole.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 05:35;1;12;This is just FUD. With an easy-to-ASIC algorithm, it would be strictly easier for new startups to compete.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 05:31;0;0;This has nothing to do with religious freedom (which, as an aside, is heresy and not legitimate);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 05:31;0;2;Are you confessing to sybil attacking the poll?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 05:21;0;0;Obviously prosecuting murder falls well within the jurisdiction of government.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 05:19;0;0;Because you can't prevent miners from pretending to be multiple smaller miners.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.06.2018 05:18;0;2;PoW change would actually be good for good miners - they will end up with a larger share of the pie than they can get with SHA2.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;18.06.2018 18:26;0;10;This is the correct response. However, consider that Lightning only needs the onboarding tx(s), whereas BCH needs an on-chain tx for every logical transaction. So unless people transact less than 32 times each year...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.06.2018 18:24;1;1;"Buildings or not, I don't think we can say the Church is restored"" until we have a pope.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.06.2018 18:23;1;35;There's a difference between being unable to use something and choosing not to use it. Satoshi chose not to use those payment systems because he wanted a feature that isn't present in mere payment systems. That's exactly Samson's point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.06.2018 18:20;0;0;Not sure you understand what spam is. They're not regular users. They're just bloating the chain to bloat the chain or drive up fees.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.06.2018 18:17;0;0;How about logic that adjusts the min fee upward to produce a given max block size? (And doesn't adjust down ever);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.06.2018 18:12;0;0;Unless they rise it high enough to price out spammers (which would be annoyingly high for everyone else who isn't using Lightning yet), we wouldn't get the benefit of smaller blocks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.06.2018 18:10;0;0;Reduced block sizes don't force miners to prefer lower fee txs over higher fee ones...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.06.2018 17:59;0;0;If you restrict average block size, you may get a wild reward discrepancy between the miners who fill their blocks, and the miners forced to mine empty ones.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.06.2018 17:38;0;1;A fee that costs an egg in value vs a fee that costs a used car in value are very different, even if they are the same bitcoin amount at two different times.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.06.2018 17:20;0;0;Fees are relative to current price. It isn't a good idea to add it to the consensus protocol.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.06.2018 01:48;0;0;Namecoin could almost do it, but their names expire...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.06.2018 01:31;0;1;Bitcoin addresses represent a single-use invoice, not a person. Lightning might be a better layer to add something like this in, but who is going to assign the names? What stops that authority from changing it to someone else later?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.06.2018 23:40;0;1;UASF movements are, by definition, user-initiated.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.06.2018 18:05;0;8;Or we can softfork to a lower block size limit;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.06.2018 05:33;0;4;Hopefully they made their own keys a long time ago (or removed alerts).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.06.2018 05:25;0;0;"Looks like (1) implies it is extra"", but it should really be considered a standard step of verification.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 23:54;0;1;Hmm, I missed them somehow (although I only checked the Windows instructions...?);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 20:28;0;2;Except it's wrong / a false sense of security. Needs to 1) send people to the gitian.sigs repo to get multiple signatures, and 2) explain how to verify the key the user has is the right one.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 18:32;0;2;Joe@Coinbase receives 10 BTC to 1someaddress, which creates UTXO 12345. Joe's balance is now 10 BTC. Joe sends 10 BTC to someone else, but Coinbase uses a different UTXO for that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 18:03;0;0;The signed messages in this case do not prove you can move the bitcoins at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 18:02;0;0;ie, not very.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 18:02;0;0;Addresses are never meant to be reused even by the same person.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 18:01;0;2;Regardless of you playing word games, the fact is that people with funds in Coinbase can and should be able to sign messages with their addresses there, but should not be given the private key implementing them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 18:00;0;0;Addresses are opaque.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 18:00;0;1;Signed messages don't even prove that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 09:14;0;0;There has never been a raw message signature in the first place.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 05:52;0;3;The problem is people making assumptions the signatures aren't intended to convey. Just because Joe@Coinbase signs for 1SomeAddress does not mean he still has funds sent to 1SomeAddress in the past, even if the UTXOs created in those transactions remain unconsumed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 05:29;0;2;For example, a normal Coinbase user wishes to commit to a contract to be paid at his Coinbase address.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 05:15;0;0;Nope, that's a perfectly normal situation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 04:47;0;0;"The question was what is most reliable?"", not ""what does Anthony Lusardi KNOW to be reliable?""""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 04:46;0;0;You're looking at two extremes: finding a signature, and creating it. But the expected norm for signmessage is in the middle: being *given* a signature for an arbitrary message of your choice, because the address in question (and not necessarily any UTXOs) belongs to you.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 04:08;0;0;Your lack of knowledge does not reduce the reliability of the output.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 04:08;0;0;"You don't send bitcoins from 1BvB. Nor from any other address. Addresses only receive; they never send.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 04:07;0;3;Possession of a signature does not prove you produced it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 02:59;0;1;No.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 02:59;0;0;Someone else spending.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 02:58;0;1;That's what it is...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 02:33;0;3;1. It proves only that the person who will receive a future payment to that address, agrees to a given message/terms. 2. No standard exists for this. 3. Shared/hosted wallets are SUPPOSED to let you sign messages with your addresses.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 02:32;0;0;No, you prove only that any future funds sent to the address will be received by you. It does not prove anything about private keys or current funds you might or might not have.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 02:31;0;0;That UTXO might be consumed without the recipient spending any bitcoins. Or it could remain as-is despite the recipient spending all their bitcoins.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 02:31;0;0;No, there isn't. If you send 1 BTC to address 1BvB, that address receives 1 BTC. Additionally, a UTXO for 1 BTC is created (but not associated to an address). ...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 02:29;0;0;But that's not what the signatures prove.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 02:29;0;0;There is a methodology. You just don't know it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 02:28;0;1;"1. Addresses don't hold funds. 2. Signing a message only proves you own the address; it doesn't prove you control the private key used to implement said address.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 02:28;0;1;Coins aren't sent from an address, ever. Addresses only receive.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 02:27;0;0;Addresses don't hold funds.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 01:10;0;0;Yes, but there is no relation to an address at that point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 01:08;0;1;I can only measure counts, not guess reasons.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 01:07;0;1;Sending coins wouldn't prove ownership of an address in the first place.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 01:06;0;1;Are you sure that's what they want to prove? I've seen many (most?) people trying to prove possession of funds, which current signmessages do NOT prove.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 00:51;0;2;For what functionality? Half the problem with sign/verifymessage is that people don't understand what it does and doesn't do.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 00:48;0;0;Sometimes it's pretty obvious, like right now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 00:47;0;1;Of course not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 00:47;2;6;http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/software.html …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 00:46;0;2;UTXOs don't have addresses. Whatever this is, it is clearly braindead.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 00:45;0;1;There is no standard for message sign/verify under any P2SH or Segwit addresses at all. The p2pkh schema has numerous serious problems that would need to be addressed in any updated spec.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 00:44;0;0;It absolutely would work, as it has in the past. The primary purpose of government is to impose morality. If it doesn't even do that, it isn't a government at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.06.2018 00:43;0;0;Hmm, I wonder if simple dumping on the old chain should count as economic activity making it retain the name Bitcoin...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.06.2018 19:19;0;1;That's what hardforks require. Note that when we get to smaller %s, however, there is a question about whether the remnant has enough people to actually economically interact. Only economic use counts, so they could disqualify themselves in this way.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.06.2018 18:52;0;2;If there was 1% continuing to use the current Bitcoin, any new coin is not a hardfork, and should not be allowed to call itself Bitcoin, even if 99% switch to it, and no matter what the differences are.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.06.2018 18:35;0;1;Why do you read into my tweet that I'm reading into your tweet, rather than just answering your question?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.06.2018 18:33;1;5;Yes, and releases should always be checked. Either by reading the code itself, or verifying multiple people you trust have.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.06.2018 18:33;0;1;I'm not even close to alone on it. Most of America is pro-life. And it has worked out before just fine. There's no reason it wouldn't work out again. It really is black and white.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.06.2018 18:31;0;1;Except I don't advocate the death penalty for adultery...? (Not saying it'd be a bad idea, but I'm not sure that's the right approach.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.06.2018 18:22;0;0;They do apply. Our modern governments just neglect their duty to prosecute. This isn't about feelings. It's about real objective murder.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.06.2018 18:16;0;0;Yes, you're still choosing the specific rules in question.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.06.2018 08:11;0;5;Mark used to be involved to some degree in Bitcoin development, before acquiring MtGox. And for a long time, MtGox was effectively the *only* exchange with any real liquidity.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.06.2018 08:03;0;2;No, the key was removed a while ago, and could only display messages.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.06.2018 07:55;0;1;It's basically the same thing as any other hardfork.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.06.2018 07:53;0;0;He was a central person in Bitcoin until MtGox failed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.06.2018 06:18;28;120;Be aware that people with the key include not only Core devs, but also Gavin, Mark Karpeles (and therefore likely the MtGox trustee), and various others.

LukeDashjr;15.06.2018 00:04;0;0;No, it really isn't. If you go there and troll or break the rules, sure, you'll get banned - but that's just reasonable moderation, not censorship.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.06.2018 22:01;0;0;No, miners aren't identifiable like that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.06.2018 02:35;0;0;We certainly did before Bishop Thuc passed away, and apparently nobody through it would become a problem back then (or presumably they would have acted while they still could, just as Bp. Thuc gave a formal declaration of JP2 not being pope)...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 22:15;0;2;Pretty normal...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 22:15;0;1;Also, wasn't the Western Schism resolved with a council convened by the first antipope John XXIII and his adherents? How would this situation differ substantially from that one?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 18:01;0;0;Is that all (particularly the point about only ordinary jurisdiction bishops being able to convoke a council) divine law, or is some of it positive Church law which can lose force when impossible?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 17:59;0;0;Well, I wouldn't want someone to mistake me for being qualified to discuss this with Fr. as some kind of equal in knowledge/understanding. I'm probably just on the learning end of any such discussion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 08:47;0;0;"Disclaimer: I do not positively reject the Thesis, but as a matter of opinion, as an uneducated layman in such matters, I do not find it convincing.

LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 08:44;0;1;1) Why does supplied jurisdiction not satisfy this? Surely you would not say that non-Catholics can be the hierarchy of the Church? 2) I'd think that since the law is now impossible, it falls back to the natural law, and the Catholic bishops can call a council to select a pope.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 08:38;0;6;Miners can mine whatever cryptocurrency they like. That's irrelevant to the question of which one is Bitcoin. Perhaps you misunderstood the whitepaper.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 04:24;0;6;The default behaviour with a hardfork, is to reject it. So yes, acquiescence is a vote - but it's a vote against, and makes hardforks impractical.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 03:51;1;18;That's actually a problem for Bitcoin too: we've discussed how one might show consensus on a given hardfork, and often the idea of having coin voting comes up, but realistically, we'd probably have so many non-votes that it'd be meaningless.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 03:46;0;7;I suppose that might be a risk, but in that scenario, rejecting 64-byte transactions doesn't help you. On the bright side, it seems light wallets are moving toward downloading full blocks (that they care about), so probably a non-issue once that's deployed.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 01:39;0;0;No, that is slanderous lies.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 01:34;0;0;Men can be corrupted, but the Catholic Church cannot be, since it has God as its Head.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 01:34;0;0;If the Catholic Church is not infallible in its teaching authority, there is no reason to believe a word of the Bible in the first place.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 01:31;0;0;There are no idols or vain show.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 01:28;0;0;That's a lie.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 01:28;0;0;All dissent from the Catholic Church has also dissented from His teachings.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 01:24;0;0;Again, repeating these lies won't make them true. The Catholic Church teaches only what Christ Himself taught. It is not a sect. It is Christianity.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 01:22;0;0;2Peter2 is about heretics: Arians, Protestants, and such. St. Peter acted as pope, incl. exercising authority over the other bishops when the disputes were heated (Acts 15). His successors also continued to exercise such authority. It wasn't rejected until centuries later.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 01:15;0;0;No, it is how Christ established His Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 01:15;0;0;"Satan has tried, in the form of the Arians, Muslims, Protestants, and Modernists; but the original Catholic Church, as established by Jesus, continues to exist and teach Christ's doctrine.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 01:05;0;0;No, the Catholic Church is the entirety of Christianity. Outside the Church, there is only dissent against Christ.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 01:01;0;0;Repeating lies won't make them true. Jesus established the Catholic Church, and sent the Holy Ghost to make the apostles the first Catholic bishops. The entirety of Catholic doctrine was revealed to the apostles in their lifetimes, and continued to be taught through the present.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 00:56;0;0;No, you're rewriting history. Catholicism originated with Jesus and His apostles.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 00:55;0;0;Lightning is on the mainnet, troll.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 00:55;0;0;That's complete nonsense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 00:54;0;2;Me too. I'd have to recall the vulnerability first, and then ask myself if it's been disclosed! The hardest thing with keeping them quiet, at least for me, is the risk I'll forget about them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 00:53;0;7;I don't think it actually can be used to exploit SPV clients (other than their publicly-known weaknesses) in practice. The real concern was breaking the network, which is impractical.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 00:52;0;0;The apostles were all Catholic bishops. You're trying to rewrite history now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.06.2018 00:51;0;16;(BTW, I'm pretty sure it's actually impossible to exploit against any real-world SPV wallets, since just having a destination address pushes the tx size over 64 bytes. Only risk is if this is a *parent* of an unconfirmed tx - in which case, it's totally trust-based anyway);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:34;0;2;PoW change is the solution. But it needs a general consensus on the goal before we can even reasonably start on the details.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:33;0;0;Nope. Do we? (That'd be pretty strange, since I'm not on any consistent sleep schedule...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:33;0;6;Not thinking it through, probably because it has too little community support so far.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:32;0;1;PoW changes are part of how the market works.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:31;0;1;Nonsense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:31;0;1;Completely different.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:30;0;3;Don't tolerate ASIC vendors mining, for a start... That's absurd on its own right - companies should not compete against their customers like that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:29;0;1;Is your shop going to accept payment in bitcoins, if the government is prepared to shut you down for it?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:28;0;2;No, so long as we pick a reasonable algorithm, it can't really make it any worse. And even with a bad choice, it would still buy us time before it got worse.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:27;0;0;It's not necessarily a temporary solution either. It has the potential to be a strong long-term fix. The temporary outcome is just the worst-case scenario. And even then, at least it buys us time to find a better solution.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:26;0;1;Speaking of which, you're not *really* CEO of http://Bitcoin.com , right? (I've been inclined to block you simply because of that...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:25;0;1;How is it centrally planning, when the decision is made by a decentralised community? Why do you defend a centralised SHA2 issuance instead?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:24;0;0;Rising hashrate makes it harder, not easier, for new players.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:24;0;0;ASICBoost is patented, and you can't compete with ASICBoost unless you use it yourself. Samsung is just making Halong's chips, which use the patent. I don't know what GMO is doing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:23;0;2;The killer problem is that difficulty has already adjusted up to beyond the point where most people can make a profit mining. To put new miners online now means mining becomes even more unprofitable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:20;0;0;Only the same risks that come with any hardfork - but we've successfully weathered one before, and I don't think we can avoid them forever. There are multiple good options for a new PoW, and ones with potential to be even better in development.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:18;0;1;If their new competition is at all competent, they should be more than prepared to survive a PoW change just fine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:17;0;1;It's not up to Bitcoin Core. It's up to the community. Reason 1 alone should be more than sufficient grounds for it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:15;0;1;No other ways we know of, and this is the mitigation that was planned all along. It's also extremely unlikely that other ways can be found, especially after people have been trying to solve it for years.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:14;0;0;It's patented. And even in the best case scenario, Bitmain still has their hashrate and difficulty won't let newcomers squeeze in.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:13;0;0;No, it is the truth.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:13;25;65;Ways we can observe that Bitmain has over 50% hashrate.https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1005995777674633216 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:13;0;7;I could probably keep going on and on if I think about it, but hopefully this is enough to prove the point for now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:12;2;19;"They obscure their real hashrate by pointing it at multiple pools. They sell"" miners as ""cloud mining"" (leaving the machines really in their control). They claim to avoid centralisation by running multiple datacentres (as if that helps) - basically admitting they have too much.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:10;9;39;They sell miners at far above cost to produce, enough to put quite a few of their own online for each one sold. Their sold miners ship crippled, while they can run them at full speed. Their miners make up at least 90% of the total network hashrate. ...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:03;2;15;Bitmain has been caught installing backdoors on miners they sell *twice* already. And since they violate the open source licenses, it's not even reasonable to hope you can find all the backdoors that are undoubtedly still in there.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 04:01;0;0;No, PoW change does not cost most people anything. It costs Bitmain. It costs the minority of independent miners who actually make a profit. If Halong and GMO are incompetent, it could cost them as well. But it costs 99% of the community *nothing*.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 03:55;0;1;China is just one country, thankfully.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 03:54;0;1;Money now vs money later. Also, that money later is just *possibly* money later, since difficulty rises. Finally, when there isn't a monopoly, the companies need to compete against each other on sales prices.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 03:53;0;1;Most node software has a wallet built-in you can just use.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 03:53;0;5;Remotely accessing your hot wallet secure at home, enforcing spending limits you've chosen in advance, 2FA checks, etc.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 03:51;1;7;It's not really a good idea to keep keys on a phone anyway.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 03:49;0;3;The value of currency comes from public acceptance and usage of it. The value of files you share comes entirely from the content of those files. If Bitcoin is banned, it might still technically work, but it will be worthless.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 03:48;0;0;Problem is, Bitmain is going to build and put more miners of their own online with the profits they make from overcharging you. And when they put theirs online, they will run it at full speed, whereas yours is artificially limited to ~80 Th/s.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 03:46;0;1;There are many possible PoW changes, with varying pros and cons. As broken as SHA2 is today, I would support (almost?) any of them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 03:45;1;1;SHA256 is already broken today, in terms of usage as a PoW algorithm (which is different from usage as a cryptographic hash function).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 03:44;0;1;Just like SHA256 *used to be*.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 03:44;0;0;1. We had LOTS of competition. It died when Bitmain compromised SHA2. 2. There's no reason this should scare anyone away.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 03:43;2;12;No, there really isn't. You just install and use it like you would any other wallet (most of which have much inferior UIs). Holding your own keys is a false sense of security if you're not also running your own node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 03:42;0;0;That they would come out ahead if we do it, for example.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 00:24;0;3;Using Bitcoin doesn't take up your time, just your computer's time...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.06.2018 00:23;0;3;Just to secure Bitcoin. Bitmain could solve this overnight and profit at the same time by publishing how to use their asicboost and liquidating all or at least most of the miners under their control.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.06.2018 23:37;1;1;File sharing can be done in private. Money is inherently a public thing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.06.2018 23:36;2;2;Modernists are neither Catholics nor the Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.06.2018 23:32;3;6;No need to destroy ASICs. It's entirely possible that down the road, if Bitmain liquidates, it may make sense to switch back to SHA2.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.06.2018 15:42;0;1;It matches with the observable facts.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.06.2018 15:40;0;1;They're playing dirty already by spreading this FUD to try to prevent a PoW change.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;10.06.2018 03:01;0;0;With a fair market, you won't be able to get 50% hashrate of Bitcoin because everyone and their dog will be mining it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.06.2018 02:59;0;4;Except BCH actually gives that power to the miners, by eliminating non-mining full nodes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.06.2018 02:54;0;3;There is too little support right now to reasonably predict when there will be consensus.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.06.2018 02:53;0;1;More FUD. Centralised hashrate does not protect the network. Nobody is talking about changing the coin limit.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.06.2018 02:52;0;0;It's just FUD to claim this would kill Bitcoin. It would do nothing of the sort.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;8.06.2018 20:45;0;0;Wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.06.2018 20:34;0;0;Welcome to a few years ago. SHA2 vulnerability has been found and exploited...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;8.06.2018 19:54;0;0;And it may not be a certainty, but it's only common sense to prepare for a PoW change in the current situation, even IF it came with a performance hit (which again, it wouldn't).

LukeDashjr;8.06.2018 19:53;0;0;There is no efficiency loss to have a simple backup PoW algorithm.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;8.06.2018 19:36;0;1;Oppression and monarchy are two different things.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;8.06.2018 18:27;0;2;There are many companies out there. So long as the new algorithm is simple enough to put them on an equal playing field with Bitmain, Bitmain loses at least most of their current advantage.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.06.2018 17:59;0;0;Only to brick Bitmain. ASICs are inevitable and desirable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.06.2018 17:58;0;3;A PoW change is strictly an improvement. You can speculate that they might survive - fine - but to say they would get stronger has no basis and is pure FUD.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.06.2018 17:56;0;0;It's not enough for a manuf to simply prepare for it - the community would need to choose the manuf's backup algorithm too. So no, Bitmain can't prepare for it, because it wouldn't make sense for us to support their algo.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;7.06.2018 00:36;0;3;Geographic distribution is meaningless if the machines are under the legal control of a single entity.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.06.2018 00:34;0;0;"...to ASIC-resistant"" algorithms*""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.06.2018 00:16;0;1;We can observe whether the ASICs they make are kept in-house or distributed widely. At the end of the day, that's all we should care about.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 20:34;0;0;Without due process, however, it's more like vigilantism... with all the problems and evil that entails.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 20:29;0;0;If they're not malicious, the community should support their algorithm too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 20:24;0;1;1) You can't compare hashrates of different algorithms at all. 2) Lower hashrate decentralised is more secure than higher hashrate centralised.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 20:22;0;0;No idea what you're talking about. It's been standard advice for ASIC producers since the start. The only way ASIC miners can be made to still work after a PoW change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 20:20;0;0;You have it backward. ASICs can only do specific algorithms. But the community picks which algorithms we accept.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 20:20;0;1;Individualism is a big part of the problem in modern society.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 20:18;0;0;Only a State can properly deal with murderers.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 20:18;0;0;The market can only get so much bigger before difficulty adjusts upward making it even more unprofitable than it already is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 20:17;0;0;No, current manufacturers can and should have chips capable of SHA2 and also a manufacturer-specific SHA2 variant. This is trivial to add. Then when the community changes PoW, they disclose their variant so we can accept it as a valid option.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 20:03;0;1;High fees are a result of spam, not block size. Confirmation times are only slow when your fee is below the spam floor.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 20:03;0;0;It's trivial for new entrants to prepare for a PoW change with almost no overhead cost.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 20:02;0;1;What makes you think it won't just be a repeat of 2013-2015 when we had LOTS of competition on SHA2, most of which died out as Bitmain rose to power? In any case, I hope/trust GMO/Halong weren't so foolish as to not make ASICs with a backup algorithm as recommended.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 19:56;0;3;They don't have the advantage over the new PoW as they do with SHA2. They'd need to compete on equal terms with everyone else.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 19:55;0;0;Block size is not a problem *at all*, at this time, and probably not for decades. SHA2 being compromised is a reality today, that we should solve ASAP.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 19:54;0;0;Hopefully the new algorithm won't be broken like SHA2 was. Aside, showing willingness to act to address centralisation also sets a strong incentive NOT to centralise the network for anyone in the future.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 19:53;0;0;GPUs are only temporary. The goal should be a competitive ASIC market ASAP. Bitmain is a bad actor. They are the monopoly controlling SHA2. Sour grapes to them is fine. Anyone else should have planned and prepared for this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 19:50;0;0;That's stupid, and doesn't encourage entry particularly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 19:48;0;0;PoW HF actually addresses a real problem. Block sizes aren't a problem (and are already 2+ MB possible).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 19:48;0;1;And when I violate those rules?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 19:47;0;0;GPU would only be temporary, and Bitcoin has far more than enough market to keep it ahead of the competition anyway. Anyhow, this is only part of the security matter. The bigger part is centralisation, which SHA2 is completely.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 19:47;0;0;There are plenty of competing coins using SHA2. If you want an exclusive PoW, you need to change, and even then, you can't stop others from adopting the new algo. Best you can do is make merge mining trivial so they can be cooperative.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 19:45;0;2;ASIC isn't a problem. Centralisation is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 19:41;0;1;Nothing. We don't need to stop Bitmain. We just need to make it easy enough that others can compete. Halong & GMO should already have made plans for this possibility. We've recommended ASICs support a backup PoW since 2012, even before it was needed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 19:40;0;1;FUD. A PoW change HF would only improve security.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 19:18;0;0;Historically, almost every democracy turns into a dictatorship. Monarchies have often NOT had that outcome (and instead failed only when evil people rebelled).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 19:17;0;1;It's FUD. Sure, you *could* change to a PoW that has that effect, but you can also change to one that has the OPPOSITE effect (ie, easier for new entrants). It's the latter which I support.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 19:14;0;1;I don't think government (or anyone else) should be able to confiscate money without due process. I'm no fan of inflation either. But I also consider the extreme of anarchy to be pretty much insane, and recognise that government is necessary and good for society in principle.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 19:13;4;16;The problem is Bitmain has control over >50% of mining hardware (NOT including hardware they've sold/shipped, which they've been caught backdooring before).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 06:19;0;3;Again, missing the point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 05:51;0;1;No, I don't think the Church should interfere in temporal matters except perhaps in extreme cases. However, the State should recognise the true religion (Catholicism) as such, and order its laws according to the moral principles thereof.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 05:50;0;2;I don't know if their ASICs support it at all. Just saying: reward isn't so important, and giving it to people isn't a solution.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 05:18;0;1;Yes, but spam is frankly not even close to the biggest issue with miner centralisation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 05:05;1;4;"In fact, Bitmain could hard-lock all their chips to give all the reward to Bitmain only, and distribute those chips to everyone else; and that wouldn't be a problem for the network. All that matters is the full node they're run against, NOT where the reward goes.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 05:04;0;1;No, that makes no difference whatsoever.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 05:03;0;0;I don't know of anything written in that format yet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 04:59;0;1;Paul, Anthony is right on this particular matter. Popes cannot bind future popes. http://www.fathercekada.com/2007/05/17/quo-primum/ …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 04:59;0;1;No, it doesn't. If you think it does, you're not paying attention to what I'm talking about in the first place...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 04:57;0;1;We're not limited to choosing just one.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 04:49;0;1;On the other hand, the Holy Inqusition was renowned for its fairness and mercy, so those accused of temporal crimes would even go so far as to utter heresy to get transferred there from the civil courts. So there's that, too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 04:37;0;2;Yes, which is why I dislike theocracy. Both extremes have problems.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 04:14;0;0;The Church is perfect. It does not fall into corruption.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 04:13;1;1;You don't have a choice in democracy unless you choose the same way as most other people.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 04:11;0;0;(And nobody but Halong knows HalongSHA2 until consensus is reached. Likewise for CanaanSHA2, etc.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 04:11;0;0;Halong creates and supports HalongSHA2 in addition to SHA2. Canaan creates and supports CanaanSHA2 in addition to SHA2. Maybe Bitmain also makes a BitmainSHA2 in addition to SHA2. When the community has consensus for a PoW change, we allow either HalongSHA2 *OR* CanaanSHA2.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 03:50;0;6;Bitmain doesn't even need to shut down to save SHA2. They could just make miners and leave running them to the community.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 02:47;0;2;"What an idiotic thing to say"" -my wife""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 02:46;0;0;No, each manufacturer can only add their own, because they won't know what the others have.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 02:17;0;1;Assuming Halong is competent and benevolent, their chips should already be ready for a PoW change. (If the assumption is not true, they kinda deserve any loss they take. We've been advising they prepare for PoW change since long before it was needed.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 02:16;0;0;There is no monarchy today. Democracies and similar governments have taken over the world. You have lots of choices. Monarchists have ZERO.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 01:43;0;1;No, He only established the Catholic Church. You can tell which one that is by the four marks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 01:29;0;1;I doubt I'm wrong this time, and unless we get consensus, I will probably never be proven wrong either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 01:28;0;1;Government tries and tends to become a religion when you try to separate Church and State. That's part of why such separation is so terrible.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 01:27;0;0;But He condemned them for their hypocrisy and Scripture-only positions. Not on politics.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 01:06;0;0;???;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 00:55;0;0;Monarchy is not dictatorship.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 00:55;0;0;Fewer than probably should have.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 00:54;1;0;No, you're just sewing confusion here. Softforks are softforks, not hardforks at all. Hardforks don't *require* upgrading - they *fail unless* everyone upgrades immediately. Softforks *still work* if some people don't upgrade.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 00:49;0;0;Jesus didn't oppose any governments of His time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 00:48;0;0;Except religion isn't about what sounds nice. It's about reality. And in reality, God *doesn't* inspire most people individually. Instead, He has chosen to establish a Church that He guides us through.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2018 00:47;0;0;Sure, but the Church gives final judgements on most relevant issues. If there was justification to rebel against the Nazis, I'm pretty sure the Church would have said so.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 23:55;0;2;Once finished, they should only be replaced;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 23:54;0;0;The Church is run by God;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 23:53;1;5;There's a wiki page, which is probably better than a BIP since things can change... https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_manufacturer_tech_guidelines …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 21:24;0;0;I don't think that claim would stand up to scrutiny.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 21:24;0;0;AFAIK the Church never denounced Nazi Germany or Stalin Soviet Russia *as not being legitimate governments* (they were denounced for plenty of other reasons ofc). That would seem to indicate they were legit. Only a legitimate government can execute a criminal post-facto.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 21:18;0;0;I never said legitimate government trumped God.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 21:15;0;2;The correct interpretation is confirmed easily: almost immediately after God gave the Ten Commandments, He also commanded the creation of such statues for purposes of worship aide (as Catholics use them). If the Protestant numbering/context was correct, this would contradict.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 21:14;0;2;"The so-called (by Protestant heretics) 2nd commandment"" when taken out of the proper context (""combined"" with the first part), has a very different meaning than intended. Hence why protestants object to having statues.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 21:10;0;0;You're oversimplifying. The US governments, for example, objectively demonstrate ability to provide for common good a just governance. There are many abuses, yet the law is generally directed toward the common good, and often serves that purpose.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 21:08;1;4;"Furthermore, GMO is not the only non-Bitmain manufacturer. Assuming @ HalongMining/ @ Samsung and/or @ canaanio also have their own backup algorithms, we can make the new PoW BIP be any of these: GMO-SHA2 OR Halong-SHA2 OR Canaan-SHA2""""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 21:06;0;1;The community would never adopt a PoW change if the new PoW was centralised. This only works if GMO has fairly sold their miners widely, and aren't self-mining [at least, not to a problematic degree].;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 21:05;0;0;I don't know why it's so hard for you to understand that abuses can occur even within a legitimate government....;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 20:39;0;0;You trolling? Only the current SHA2 is centralized.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 20:29;0;0;This just demonstrates you are unable to discuss topics in depth;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 20:26;0;0;No, Protestants split the first, and combined the 9th and 10th;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 20:25;0;0;Abuse of power doesn't make a government illegitimate, though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 19:44;0;1;That government is not illegitimate just because they abuse power. You need to obey their just laws, since they are legitimate.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 19:43;0;1;But if the Nazis put you to death for murder (and you're really guilty of it), they are justified in that despite their abuses.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 19:35;0;1;No;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 19:35;0;3;No risk since it's painless to just not use if it's never needed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 19:34;0;5;It can probably be as simple as a single gate. Not difficult or costly at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 19:33;0;0;Abusive rulers should not necessarily be removed from power. Certainly not from below. If the State has ceased to be a State at all, then a new State can be established and go after the former State as if it were any other criminal organization.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 19:31;0;0;God teaches us His doctrine (including the limits of State authority) thorough His Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 19:28;0;0;You say that as if consent is the only possible criteria, which is nonsense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 19:27;0;0;No, the idea of just is up to God, who gives authority to the State.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 19:15;0;0;Wrong;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 19:15;0;0;That doesn't logically follow.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 19:14;1;8;No, it's been recommended for ASICs since the start. Each manufacturer should come up with their own, and then the BIP would adopt all that the community supports allowing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 19:13;0;0;Probably taking them out of context or some such nonsense;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 19:02;0;6;This guy should be ignored, at least on this topic. He ignores correction and continues to promote his ignorant ideas.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 19:01;0;0;Yes, it does. We don't obey their evil or unjust laws, but we must always obey just laws.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 18:59;1;6;Some variant of SHA2 that other chips are unlikely to support, that can be disclosed and used as a new PoW algorithm once consensus is reached to change PoW.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 18:53;0;0;It's a lie. That was how it originally was. Besides, the Bible gets its authority from the Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 18:51;0;0;History. Monarchy has been implemented before, and yielded much better results than modern governments.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 18:50;1;9;Will it ship with BFGMiner support? Does it have a backup algorithm so Bitcoin can change PoW without bricking it?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 18:45;0;0;A checkpoint is inherently necessary for a PoW change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 18:11;0;1;I never said that authority was absolute/unlimited, nor that all laws are justified by it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 18:06;0;0;No, I never said that. Why are you making up things now?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 18:05;0;1;Nope, zero. In fact, Catholics are excluded from even voting* in Florida and probably other States. * They don't seem to actively enforce this in practice.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 18:00;0;0;Well, I'm not sure it's fair to say believing is a choice. True, many people choose to disbelieve, but it's not rational to deny what the evidence plainly shows is true.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 17:59;0;0;That's not what I said. God certainly did put Hitler and Stalin in power, and gave them legitimate authority. But that doesn't mean you can blame their abuse of that power on God.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 16:30;0;0;I didn't write it FWIW. Yes, mankind has regressed significantly. There are obviously pockets of progress (especially in technology), but society itself has regressed. The Middle Ages weren't perfect, but in this context, they were far better.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 16:28;0;0;Yes, it is immoral to drive recklessly. Your life is not your own to endanger unreasonably. There may also be others who you are endangering by doing so. It is likely right for the State to use some force (jail time) to prevent you from doing it. A fine is not force at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 16:26;0;0;No working strategy is known, hence why SPV is not possible.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 16:25;0;0;A just law is one that is within the scope of the State's jurisdiction/authority, and does not contradict a higher law. An unjust law is one which oversteps the State's jurisdiction/authority, or does contradict a higher law. AFAIK - I am not an expert on this.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.06.2018 16:20;0;0;It's not void. For example, when the State says reckless driving carries a specific fine of $100, that goes beyond merely the natural law, yet it is a just law. It assigns a specific and predictable penalty for doing something wrong.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 06:06;0;0;There are many possibilities I can imagine. Lying is one of them. But probably most likely (at least if we give him the benefit of the doubt) is that you misunderstood him.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 06:04;0;1;Possible? Yes. Likely? No. Reasonable? No. ASIC-resistance is stupid.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 06:03;0;1;Author lost all credibility with the first sentence. Clearly written by a troll.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 06:02;0;12;Nope, that's the trolls pretending the block size limit is still 1 MB.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 06:02;0;0;Now this is just FUD/trolling.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 06:00;0;1;My point is only that changing to PoW XYZ now doesn't make it any *harder* to change to PoW ABC later.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:59;0;1;No, he doesn't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:59;1;3;The *policy* to only allow up to 40 bytes following an OP_RETURN opcode, is not part of the Bitcoin system, just something each node configures for itself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:54;0;1;No reason we couldn't change more than once if better algorithms come about in the future.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:53;0;0;Fees aren't a problem for security. If you don't want to pay 25ct for a transfer, don't buy 25ct worth of security for it... Bitcoin was not designed for microtransactions. Despite that, Lightning will make all of what you're asking for here possible anyway.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:51;0;0;Congestion and security are two different things.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:46;0;1;Good work. This is an example of how BCH should be promoted. (Except for the mempool nonsense at the end.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:39;0;1;Making zk-SNARK proofs would be useful work. Not as efficient as not producing proofs, but at least it'd be doing *something* (and if miners optimise zk-SNARK ASICs enough, we could end up with nice SNARK CPUs...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:28;0;0;Even the 1 MB block size limit was dangerously high, and despite that we just increased it to 2 MB anyway. Any further increases would just be plain suicide, so it would be impossible to get consensus for it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:22;0;1;Correct. Otherwise, miners could hold the network hostage such that other miners couldn't mine anymore.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:20;1;1;"No, valid to invalid"" is a softfork. Hardforks are ""invalid to valid"".""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:16;1;14;Read on in the thread for a more detailed explanation... (or just pretend BCH is doing something it isn't, like the rest of the trolls...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:10;0;13;You're the perfect example of exactly such a scammer. Goodbye.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:10;0;1;They would need to provide a UTXO diff as well, but otherwise correct.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:09;0;0;Minor note: RISC-V is actually less open source than POWER9.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:08;0;1;In a competitive mining market, even the subsidy would approach it, since people would continually put new miners online until difficulty caught up to the point of the subsidy barely breaking even.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:07;0;0;Also, bigger blocks will result in BCH turning into just another centralised payment processor like PayPal, eventually including confiscation, censorship, and higher fees. It's just a matter of time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:06;0;1;Bigger blocks were not the entirety of the original scaling design. The idea was to have (real) SPV nodes that could detect and reject invalid blocks, thus achieving a similar security level as full nodes. That's the part which turned out to be impossiblehttps://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1003441699329331200 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:04;0;0;Most probable suicide, but I'm not sure it's certain yet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:03;0;8;(There were also many other hardforks before Bitcoin had any real valuation.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:03;1;11;No. Hardfork has a very specific technical meaning. It refers to a change to an existing currency (ie, not the forming of a new currency like BCH was) where blocks that were previously invalid become valid. This happened once, in 2013, when the block size limit was raised to 1 MB;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:01;0;2;And that's all assuming you *can* do all that work... Dunno if there's a good solution. This is usually where these kind of fraud proof attempts break down.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 05:00;0;4;"I think there's hope for recursive SNARKs (or similar; STARKs?) to someday replace the current full nodes; but we'd have to trust them enough to get rid of the full nodes, not just augment them - otherwise, we're back to the valid block, but not known to the network"" problem.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 04:48;0;0;But neither can anyone else... it would just end up with an Intel monopoly.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 04:45;0;3;Shoo, troll.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 04:43;0;0;Also, why are you pretending to be Greg?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 04:43;1;6;Hadn't seen that before (looks fairly new, in fact). It looks like it *might* be a viable solution, except 1) it sounds likely to be vulnerable to DoS attacks, and 2) it sounds likely to require everyone be at least *capable* of running a full node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 04:34;0;5;"Satoshi's design was to have proofs. He called them alerts"" in the whitepaper, but he wasn't fool enough to suggest useless alerts - the intent all along was to have something verifiable.

LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 04:33;0;5;If it is inaccessible to full nodes, it is in practice the same as if the block is invalid.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 04:32;0;0;You can't force ASICs to hard-code something they don't want to hard-code...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 04:31;0;0;I did get contact info for the relevant people at GMO while I was in Tokyo last year, but somehow lost it on my trip home.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 04:17;0;0;You fix it by making the specialized hardware easy for anyone to produce, and cheap.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 04:16;1;21;"What good is an alert"" without a proof? Completely useless. I'm sorry if you still don't get it, but your failure of understanding doesn't mean I'm misleading anyone.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 04:10;0;5;Putting aside the complexity of doing all that... Let's say it's done. Now, what happens if an attacker makes such a proof for his block, but withholds the block itself from everyone else?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 04:07;0;2;Unlikely, since I'm blocking you, troll.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 04:07;1;14;BCH is not instant and final. Bitcoin will be soon (with Lightning).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 04:02;1;23;By only accepting what they can prove conclusively to be valid. They can check all the data, but they can't make a proof of it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 03:56;0;16;There's more that one way to make an invalid block. They get dropped from the network by everyone's full node rejecting them.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 03:28;2;21;You can only prove a block is valid, and only by running a full node. Proving the negative isn't possible.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 03:05;8;91;BCH rejects that requirement, to the point where they will eventually become just yet another PayPal. Bitcoin works to make that requirement a realistic proposition instead, maintaining the original project goals.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 03:04;5;65;Since the security of a decentralised network is necessarily derived from a majority of the economy being secure, this impossibility of real SPV means that the only alternative (at least so far) is to have almost everyone running their own full node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 03:03;7;71;"Also, it turns out rejecting only invalid blocks is insufficient - unknown valid blocks would also need to be rejected to be secure. The light wallets we have today (erroneously called SPV"") are completely insecure, and not a viable alternative to running a full node yourself.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 03:01;15;114;The original design was to have full nodes create proofs of invalid blocks, to alert SPV nodes to them. SPV nodes would then verify these proofs and reject the invalid blocks. But it turns out, it isn't possible to prove a block is invalid.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 03:00;0;19;Block weight is 4MWU. Block size is up to 4 MB, but realistically closer to 2 MB in practice. Segwit data is part of the block size just as witness data always has been.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 02:50;1;32;Bitcoin already increased the block size limit to 2-4 MB, idiot.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 02:50;1;9;Shoo scammer;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 02:49;0;3;That's not what I said.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 02:49;0;0;I don't lie.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 02:48;0;5;Why are you lying about what I said?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 02:47;12;98;We're working on the same system, just improved with newer tech. BCH is NOT continuing with the original design. The original design was impossible. Impossible is really impossible. Nobody in BCH has any idea how to make it possible - they just lie through their teeth about it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 02:46;0;16;BTC is closest to the original paper as well.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 02:45;0;0;Like I said, it might not be perfect. But ideally, privacy should be done without mixing (eg, CoinJoin with others spending their bitcoins at the same time as you).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 02:44;0;3;"I'm not sure a split"" is even really a thing at all.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 02:44;0;0;Express that you support the idea, and be ready to switch to the software implementing it when (and only when) consensus is reached.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 02:41;1;46;Bitcoin didn't split in two. You just decided to leave because you didn't like that your unreasonable demands weren't met in their entirety.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 02:40;0;1;Pretty much any other PoW is more secure at this point. Lots of good options out there to choose from.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 02:39;0;0;Half? Once Lightning is in production use, I expect to see fees drop to a fraction of BCH.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 02:39;0;5;That's up to the community. There seems to be a lot of effort needed to overcome the FUD spread about PoW changes. :/;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 01:13;0;0;It's not a bitcoin economy when it's not bitcoins... The only recourse to fraud is to sue people in court, or get a prosecutor to take the case. But realistically, you'll need to target people who definitely should know better to get a successful conviction.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;4.06.2018 01:04;0;1;Hashrate is meaningless in this regard too. The rules are decided by the Bitcoin economy and their full nodes. In any case, 10% isn't consensus, period. Consensus is 100% or at least close to it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 22:39;0;7;It's not impossible with a PoW change. Eg, if we switched to a zk-SNARK proving PoW, it could incentivise/fund development of zk-SNARK provers.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 22:38;0;3;BCH issued a pre-mine of their new currency to everyone who possessed bitcoins on 2017 Aug 1st.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 22:37;0;4;It doesn't really. They were just too lazy to implement their pre-mine efficiently.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 22:36;0;4;It would look like when Bitcoin hardforked in 2013 May (note: NOT the March crisis). You wouldn't even notice it happened. There would only be one currency.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 22:35;1;24;What BCH did is no different from any other pre-mine issuing new currency to Bitcoin holders. That they were too lazy to implement it in a sane fashon doesn't change that.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 22:24;0;1;Your initial comment is still nonsense. The block size is unrelated to any of this, beyond perhaps being the motive of spammers to attack us.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 22:23;0;6;I think most of the misunderstanding Bitcoin is on the technical side.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 22:22;0;15;BCH issued a pre-mine to everyone who controlled bitcoins as of 2017 Aug 1.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 22:21;0;0;Yes, although the document is dated and may not be entirely accurate (we've learned more since then).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 22:21;6;83;Liar. BCH is a centralised system where you must get Bitmain's permission to transact. Bitcoin users run full nodes and soon Lightning-enabled wallets, so their transactions are truly p2p.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 21:34;0;9;Blockstream had nothing to do with it. Nor does it have anything to do with sidechains. Nor did *anyone* single-handedly make such a decision - each node decides for itself what OP_RETURN sizes it will tolerate.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 21:29;0;7;Misled or delusional? The fact remains that BCH isn't Bitcoin. BCH'ers who want BCH to succeed should aim to inform their community of the facts, so that it's promoted honestly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 21:28;0;14;I don't know Blockstream's business model. No, Blockstream does not control any of the Bitcoin development resources or code. How is *what* open source? Full code for Bitcoin is publicly available...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 21:09;2;15;Sure, use both if you like (or even just BCH alone if you don't like Bitcoin). My only problem is with people fraudulently trying to pass off BCH as something it's not (Bitcoin).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 21:07;0;2;BTG isn't Bitcoin either obviously.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 21:06;3;89;They should use and promote BCH *honestly*. The BCH community and the Bitcoin community are two different things, and going their own different directions.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 20:50;4;45;Liar. There is only one Bitcoin. BCH is just yet another altcoin that launched on 2017-08-01 (while Bitcoin continued functioning as-is).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 20:38;0;4;"No, it isn't an opinion. There is no such currency as Bitcoin Core"". Bitcoin doesn't get renamed just because you scammers want to pretend your new altcoin is equivalent.""";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 19:12;0;0;That link seems to be bogus btw.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 19:11;0;1;Yes, the blockchain cannot provide any special security for extra data, so putting it on-chain for no reason is spam and abusive. Why do you assume miners are running Core to that degree? Even if true, that's the miners doing it, not Core.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 19:04;0;0;Yet another CEO demonstrates complete ignorance on how Bitcoin works...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 18:57;0;0;The blockchain can only secure certain things. Nobody is calling such usage an attack or spam - only actual spam is discouraged. Core directs Core, not Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 18:26;0;2;No, it is intentionally not public to avoid scammers trying to game it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 18:21;0;0;FlexTrans fails to distinguish properly between the network protocols and the consensus protocol. Segwit SF on the other hand was designed with that distinction in mind, which is how it retains backward compatibility, and why it is much better.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 18:18;1;9;The problem is when smart people comment outside of their limited area of expertise. Suddenly, they're not so smart anymore.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 18:02;0;1;No hijacking has taken place, idiot.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 18:01;0;0;So is BCH (the subsidized fees won't last forever).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 18:00;0;2;Also, the SF version was strictly better. It's absurd to claim FlexTrans is superior.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 16:13;0;13;Mint and Gentoo are actually built on and compatible with Linux. The equivalent would be a Bitcoin sidechain like Liquid. BCH, on the other hand, is not Bitcoin in any meaningful sense - it is the same as any other altcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 04:09;0;1;Way to change the topic...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 03:52;0;1;Way too much goes into that than can be covered in even a full day, much less on Twitter.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 01:44;1;15;"I mean, I understand that spam filtering can be hard to automate. But when someone explicitly reports it and a human looks at it... to have that report rejected as not a violation"" is just incompetence or worse.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 01:38;0;7;I wouldn't be surprised if bribery was involved in the @ bitcoin account. But surely Twitter can at least deal with the blatant stuff?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 01:32;0;7;Not sure blatant scammers would be able to bribe Twitter... I'm talking about these doubler/giveaway scams that have been popping up lately.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 01:29;29;179;Apparently @ Twitter doesn't consider blatant scam spams hijacking others names/photos to be a violation of their rules... What are they thinking??;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 01:20;0;1;I haven't even once brought up the Bible today.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 01:20;0;2;Depends on the sidechain design. As far as the main chain is concerned, they're basically nothing more than multisig wallets (possibly complicated ones).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 01:19;0;2;Nobody can draw a line. Sidechains are permissionless.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 00:38;0;1;So until B actually goes online and does these things, the blockchain's involvement in the transaction is meaningless.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 00:37;0;1;The entire purpose of the blockchain is to prove to B that the transaction occurred irreversibly. Until it does that, with respect to a given transaction, it is meaningless. But an essential step to this is B running his own full node, validating the blocks mining it, etc.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.06.2018 00:12;0;1;Shows you just don't understand how Bitcoin works.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 23:52;0;1;Until B confirms for himself that it's been received and mined with sufficient work in valid blocks, the whole system is meaningless (for that transaction). So it really is A to everyone to B. You're correct that pre-Lightning transactions are more lag-tolerant, though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 23:51;0;4;Things aren't black and white. The problems are significantly reduced by an armed citizenry.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 22:31;0;1;Even 1000 AD was too late to make this claim.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 22:01;0;1;That speaks poorly of such scientific journals, if they really claim so.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 22:01;0;1;That all bishops have authority to forgive or retain sins does not change the fact that the papacy has always had universal jurisdiction.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 22:00;0;6;Generally, its survival depends on doing something that centralised alternatives cannot do. More specifically, irreversible and uncensorable transfers of money.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:47;0;0;I'm not sure there's a meaningful distinction in this case.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:46;0;0;Sorry, can't play the indoctrination card on a convert. Try again. How you like it is irrelevant. God likes His Church centralised, and He's the boss.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:45;1;24;It's sad how few entrepreneurs understand Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:44;0;2;Except it's true.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:44;0;1;Sounds like someone has too many bitcoins.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:41;0;3;There's this, but it's a bit dated and may have inaccuracies:https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0050.mediawiki …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:39;0;0;This seems wrong. By 40, women are typically ending their generative years...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:36;0;0;As more of the older Catholics die off, the Modernists are going to try to rewrite history such that the historical Catholic Church is seen as teaching Modernist heresies. I'm not sure what we can do to prevent this, but I'm sure God has a plan.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:35;0;9;Hard to claim Bitcoin has never gone down after 2013's crisis. False confirmations is not only down, it's worse than down.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:34;0;1;Because Bitcoin isn't just an idea. It's also a specific cryptocurrency.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:33;0;4;(But regardless of how you compare, the fact is and will always remain that BCH is NOT Bitcoin, but a new system launched in 2017 August.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:33;3;74;It depends on how you're comparing. BCH gives up on Bitcoin's primary goals, whereas BTC gives up only on technical details that were found to be impossible, and adds on top with newer innovation to accomplish the original goals.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:31;0;0;There's only so much work one person can do. That's why there's delegation. In any case, you're 2000 years too late to argue this. The fact remains that for the first 1000 years of Christianity, the papacy's authority went undisputed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:25;0;0;No, that doesn't follow.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:24;0;0;Only the seriously deluded think that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:24;0;1;Wrong. Science merely discovers that God has created/defined.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:23;0;0;That does not logically follow.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:23;0;0;God is existence. The causal universe cannot exist without being created, since we know from science that everything in it needs a cause.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:07;0;0;(Blocking this guy for wasting my time with nonsense.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:06;0;0;Yawn, twist it how you like. You've obviously made up your mind. History clearly shows another story, however.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:05;0;0;God is not created. He is the Creator - the uncaused cause of everything else.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:02;0;0;"The only difference is the default behaviour of neglected nodes: with a softfork, the default behaviour is to consent; with a hardfork, the default behaviour is to reject.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:02;0;0;Neither are coercive. You can always softfork away from a softfork you don't like. And even if they were coercive, it would be one set of nodes coercing the others.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 21:00;0;0;Catholicism is not contrary to common sense, and it is not wise to disregard the claims of Truth Himself (ie, God, who revealed Catholicism to the world).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:59;0;5;I don't know why you think this makes a point. It doesn't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:58;0;0;No, it doesn't, because he resigned the Antioch See.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:57;0;0;They didn't accept his argumentation until he exercised his papal authority by defining a final resolution.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:56;0;0;Christianity does not depend on writings.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:55;0;0;It's a historical fact that none ever questioned in any sense until the 10th century or so.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:54;0;4;They don't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:53;0;1;Furthermore, they are not merely ordinary humans either - besides their (typically 8 years) seminary training, they are ordained, which changes the very nature of their soul, and gives them the graces to speak sound advice as well as forget what they are told in confession.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:53;0;1;God will never hold us culpable for a sin if we follow the advice of His clergy on a topic we are uncertain on.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:51;0;0;The bishops were all arguing in heated debate, and suddenly St. Peter declares a final resolution. The rest of them present all accept it without question.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:47;0;0;I'm not so dumb as to reject good advice from individuals more qualified than myself. Confession is not really an option any more than being unable to fly unaided is an option. There was still no force involved, merely good education.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:46;0;0;Because that is what God directed the Church to teach.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:45;0;1;Says God, who is the only one who gets to define morality (just as He defines physics, math, etc).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:44;0;0;"No. As a human, you have authority to kill beasts, plants, bugs, etc; but you do not have authority to kill other humans unless God Himself authorises it.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:43;1;0;You're wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:43;0;1;"The Church does not teach that someone stealing"" food for his family out of desperation is guilty of sin. It is not theft at all, since the possessor of the bread is morally obliged to give it to him.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:42;0;0;Once we get to age 7-8, we are capable of knowing some things are wrong. That we still have uncertainties on other things is irrelevant - we can still confess what we do know (and ask for advice on what we're unsure of).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:41;0;0;That's false. It was a position of honour AND authority. That authority was also used as early as the Council of Jerusalem, and documented in the Scriptures (Acts 15). St. Peter was the pope, not St. Paul, and his final See was in Rome.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:30;0;3;I don't. That would indicate a severe mental disorder of my person.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:29;0;1;It is true that imperfect contrition (ie, that out of fear, etc) is not as good as perfect contrition (ie, out of love for God), but either is sufficient to have sins remitted in the confessional. (Perfect contrition is required to have sins remitted PRIOR TO confession.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:25;0;0;No, it is objective, as with all facts.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:25;0;0;Well, it may be impractical to prove such manslaughter in a court of law, in which case the prosecutors are justified in dropping (or not even initiating) the case.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:24;0;0;That's not historically accurate. The Council only addressed the matter of honours (not ecclesial authority), and was explicit that the bishop of Constantinople should have *second* position of honour after Rome - and that, only because the emperor resided there at the time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:19;0;1;There are many books written on the subject by persons far more qualified than I.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:19;0;0;Sin becomes possible around ages 7-8, hence why that's the typical age of first confession (my son didn't confess last year, because he was determined to not be at that point yet). Sex is unrelated to this topic.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:18;0;1;One does not require authority to state facts.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:18;0;0;No, we absolutely are not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:17;0;0;Even still, bonobos don't contracept or kill their offspring in the womb.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:17;0;0;I don't have the medical background to know what FAS level is. The government should consult those who do, to determine if an ex-mother is guilty of neglect. (Although I guess the criteria would have to be, if a reasonable person would know that level of drinking is dangerous.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:15;0;0;Even the religious services described in the Old Testament use the sign of the cross, without knowing its meaning.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:14;0;0;There is only one God, the Divine Trinity, who was the author and God of both the Old and New Testaments. Even Genesis refers to God in the plural (in the original Hebrew) to indicate the Trinity, although the dogma had not been revealed yet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:13;0;0;Catholicism is verifiable fact, the same as the rest.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:12;0;1;Modern-day Judaism has little to do with pre-Christian Judaism (which had no purpose other than to wait for Christ to transform it into Catholicism). The very principles of ancient Judiasm, was the wait for the Christ who would reveal the truths of God (Catholicism).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:11;0;1;My children aren't so poorly educated that they would prefer to die in sin, rather than repent and confess.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:10;0;0;Which is a heresy. Christ established His Church with a single human authority over the entire universe. This, too, was believed by all Christians before the Orthodox schism.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:09;0;0;Humans are not bonobos.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:09;0;1;Being wrong doesn't require someone to say it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:09;0;0;Putting a child up for adoption is just one way parents can provide for that child. Drinking while pregnant perhaps shouldn't be legal, but AFAIK there is no conclusive evidence that it is always harmful (IIRC, there is evidence in some cases it may even be beneficial.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:08;0;1;Kids are educated, either poorly (in the case of false religions) or well (in the case of Catholicism / the true religion). It's no different than educating them in history, math, physics, etc - it can be done poor or well.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:07;0;0;The idea of the filioque was always held implicitly to be true by Christians, just not formally included in the creed until after people began to wonder/question it. It was in fact Catholics who held the same beliefs as before - the only change was that it was now explicit/strict;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:06;0;4;Your premises are false. I wasn't raised Catholic. I converted because by the grace of God I saw that Catholicism was well-supported by reason/logic and science.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:05;0;0;No, it isn't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 20:04;0;0;The whitepaper uses archaic language to describe the system, and only goes over one part of Bitcoin in any case. To understand how the whole thing works, you have to study the code (Satoshi's code is fine) and socialise with the development community to learn current terminology.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:56;0;0;I won't object if you want to prosecute cases where the mother knew she was expecting, knowingly endangered the child, and miscarried as a result. But that isn't 70% of women.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:56;0;2;I dislike making that comparison, because Bitcoin really CAN be changed/hardforked with consensus. Catholicism cannot be changed under any circumstances, even with consensus (although God also guarantees there will never be such consensus anyway).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:55;0;2;Way too complicated for Twitter, and in any case would take way too much time. It's not my job to convince you, sorry.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:54;0;2;No choice. God decided that's how His religion would operate. The only appropriate action is to obey.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:53;0;0;Manslaughter requires a certain degree of neglect.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:53;0;0;But you would be wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:53;0;0;The purpose of sex is pregnancy, even if not every attempt is successful. Nobody has a right to murder a child, not even raped women.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:52;0;0;The Orthodox rejected the authorities Christ put over them. They left Christ's Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:52;0;1;No. Murder is never acceptable. A parent may choose not to provide specialized care, even if that results in death, but food, water, etc are standard care and must be provided.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:50;0;0;If that living DNA ceases to be living after you're done, you've killed an independent being. If that DNA is homo sapien, you've killed a human being.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:49;0;0;Why do you think A to C to B is less decentralised than A to everyone to B? It's a strict improvement technologically and privacy-wise.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:48;0;0;Wrong. If you're running a full node, your node does provide a critical part of that security.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:48;0;1;"You're not a user of Bitcoin if you just have a fake SPV"" wallet. An attack like 2X could go on behind your back and you wouldn't even know your coins were swapped out on you.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:47;1;1;You're probably joking, but note that it's not quite doctrinally sound. For example, involuntary ejaculation is not a sin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:46;0;0;Don't forget, he's on his way leaving your property when you kill him too...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:45;0;2;We develop the capacity to sin around the age or 7 or 8. Hence why it takes that long for a first confession in the first place.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:45;0;0;Science supports Catholicism.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:43;0;0;Miscarriage is not intentional killing. Intent is part of murder (or any crime). We don't prosecute people for accidents.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:42;0;0;"Access to guns is necessary for protecting the right to life itself. Even for crazy people (which is very subjective - it's only a matter of time until political positions are deemed crazy"").""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:40;0;2;All the denominations of protestantism were formed out of DISSENT FROM the Roman Catholic Church. Similarly, the Eastern Orthodox formed out of rebellion against the pope Christ set as an authority over them. Similarly, the Modernists formed out of dissent from Catholicism too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:40;0;2;Claims are not what matters. Truth is what matters. Catholicism is the religion that Christ Himself established, and guaranteed to preserve His doctrine against all odds. Catholicism is in fact not a denomination at all - it IS the Christian religion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2018 19:38;0;0;Here's a good read on the subject by Bishop Sanborn: http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/SSPX_QA_RevPDF2.pdf …;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 16:31;0;0;If BCH were priced higher, it's not inconceivable that they would all switch to it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 16:26;1;4;Both are possible. New entrants who actually care about Bitcoin can trivially have a backup PoW so we can change once they have enough ground.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 16:20;0;3;Is video chat going to make you more rational?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 16:19;0;1;http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/USB_Battery_Charging_1.2.pdf …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 16:14;1;24;By beginning mining, obviously. The only reason we can't, is because of the industrial miners doing it... (Yes, due to difficulty adjustment algorithm, this may require a hardfork, but users can do that.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 02:15;0;0;That's what I'd expect. It's the opposite vote I find scary.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 01:38;0;0;Users' nodes will all reject the block as invalid. In the scenario users are no longer using full nodes (ie, Bitcoin is no longer decentralised at all), miners can bypass any protections, segwit or non.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 01:33;0;0;It won't cause a network split. They just won't be mining *Bitcoin* anymore.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 01:28;0;1;No, it isn't, and no, they can't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 01:22;0;1;Except in the situation where miners have been given control over the currency rules itself - in which case, they can take both just as easily.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 01:22;0;1;Nor segwit.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 01:09;0;1;Sure, but they can do it with non-segwit wallets just as well.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 01:08;0;4;Well, that's the downside of letting your government disarm you...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 01:02;0;1;(Which is much more practical with a PoW change...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 01:02;0;1;They're not, but trolls like to pretend they are.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 00:29;0;0;"True, I took the question to mean a few big mining companies, with Fed-like power"".""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 00:28;0;0;No. Not if miners are given the same kind of control the Fed has over USD.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 00:28;0;1;I'm not in the business of evaluating chargers. I know the Nokia N900 won't work with a non-standard/Apple charger.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 00:24;0;1;Nah, I just have zero confidence in humans with no checks and no repercussions, to do the right thing instead of serve their own interests.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 00:18;0;2;It's probably not an Android charger... almost all of them today seem to follow the Apple non-standard instead of the USB standard. Only way to be sure your charger follows the standard is to get a device that rejects Apple's (Or the situation may have changed on newer hardware);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.06.2018 00:16;0;1;Because officials' mistakes can be corrected, and those officials fired, etc.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.05.2018 23:53;0;0;BCH can try that. I'll pass.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.05.2018 23:49;0;6;Apple devices don't support standard USB charging, and some Android devices don't support non-standard Apple USB charging. So there is a real difference.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.05.2018 23:46;0;0;Secret mining ops have never had this kind of power/trust. There is zero reason to expect a better outcome than with public officials, who at least can get it right *sometimes*.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.05.2018 23:43;0;19;Only 90 votes so far, but I have to say it's strange and scary so many people so far prefer secretive big mining ops over public officials...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.05.2018 23:41;0;0;(Not a perfect comparison, since those were otherwise-Catholic antipopes, and Francis isn't even close.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.05.2018 23:40;0;0;Maybe not requesting an abjuration is the mistake? But I don't think this logic holds in any case: during the Great Western Schism, people presumably didn't mix between papal claimants, yet none of them (not even adherents to antipopes) were canonically schismatic.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.05.2018 23:37;0;0;At least Mickey Mouse might hypothetically be Catholic! We know Francis isn't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.05.2018 23:36;0;2;Same here.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.05.2018 23:26;0;0;(Not to mention, the rest of the issues pretty much disappear once we have a pope to authoritatively resolve them.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.05.2018 23:26;0;0;But a much bigger issue to discuss is the election of a true pope. It should always be possible for the Church to produce a pope, so the real barrier AFAICT is disagreement between the bishops on exactly *how* to bring it about.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.05.2018 23:19;0;0;They don't have authority to make a positive Church law forbidding it, but they certainly do have authority to teach the Faith, including the immorality of attending non-Catholic religious services as the Church has taught for centuries.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.05.2018 23:17;0;0;IMO Bishop Dolan is correct on the matter raised by Fr. Stepanich. Attending the SSPX's Masses is not asking them for Sacraments or sacramentals - it is joining in their false worship. There is no meaningful distinction between the SSPX and first-gen Anglicans.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.05.2018 18:51;0;0;It's the anti-change position that hasn't thought things through.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.05.2018 18:04;0;0;Bitcoin's current PoW is so insecure, almost any change would be *at least* a short term security improvement.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.05.2018 15:06;1;42;Bitcoin has been legit since 2009.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.05.2018 23:18;0;2;Or maybe just has technical issues on how to use Twitter. It's not a very intuitive interface, so I can imagine some people having problems reading the entire thread.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.05.2018 05:17;0;1;Liar.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.05.2018 05:06;0;2;You are opposed to truth.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.05.2018 03:45;0;3;No, the Church cannot be taken.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.05.2018 01:22;0;2;"(I mean, unless you want to profess that you hold the same faith as the Ireland Catholics"" who voted for abortion, and the Chinese ""Catholics"" who support communism, and the global ""Catholic"" population that thinsk birth control is ok, et al... but even then you only get unity)""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.05.2018 01:19;1;3;People today have been brainwashed to dismiss any claim of conspiracy outright. By making false conspiracy theories en masse, they have obscured the existence of real conspiracies.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.05.2018 01:17;0;3;The Catholic Church is identified by the four marks: unity of faith, holiness (including fruits), universality, and apostolicity. Francis's sect at best has only universality.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.05.2018 01:15;0;1;Yes, I have. You have chosen to ignore it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.05.2018 01:14;0;0;That's simply not true at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.05.2018 01:14;0;0;So what does he answer with?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.05.2018 00:12;0;1;"I don't like God, so I'm going to deny He is real!"" Oh well, at least you know clearly where you'll end up, and don't waste our time trying to convince you.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.05.2018 00:07;0;0;Developers have no particular power. To act requires the community.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.05.2018 00:06;0;3;I have posted plenty of evidence. Sacerdotus works in a heretic sect at best, and only makes unfounded accusations.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.05.2018 00:04;0;0;I don't consider videos a usable form of discussion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.05.2018 22:01;0;1;No, there's a lot of legit Catholic mystics who predicted the 3DD. As with any private revelation, we don't *have* to believe it, but multiple approved mystics seems pretty probable IMO;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.05.2018 18:08;1;4;Personally, I don't think we're in the end times. More likely, God is setting precedents now, for even worse events of the end times. After all, we're supposed to have a pope and return to Christianity after the Three Days of Darkness.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.05.2018 17:33;0;3;I went through recently-changed BIPs PRs a week or so ago, and didn't come across it. Maybe I need to look further back. :/;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.05.2018 14:03;0;2;Yep, it was the Mic ones I noticed before. At this point, I've simply blocked @ Sacerdotus. No point even engaging with such dishonest people.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.05.2018 14:02;0;2;I did notice that. Maybe not him, but one of the V2 apologists in the thread had 2 socks liking everything. Although I can't find it now, so maybe they got caught or removed it?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.05.2018 13:32;0;1;As an objective fact, abortion at any point (ie, after conception) is murder.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.05.2018 03:23;0;2;Dishonest people will often be dishonest on more than just one point. :/;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.05.2018 01:37;0;2;Then why are you doing it?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.05.2018 00:27;0;0;@antiprosynthesis either doesn't/didn't understand this, or was trolling me.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.05.2018 00:13;1;4;So an anti-Christ institution and unrepentant non-Catholic guilty of ongoing grave mortal sins decide who the pope is? LOL;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.05.2018 00:11;0;0;No, it wasn't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 23:34;0;0;Now you're misrepresenting me. I wonder if that was why I had you blocked?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 23:33;0;1;It's a lot simpler to do.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 23:33;0;0;Nobody other than me is even *trying* to count non-listening nodes. It's not that they're erroneous - they're just not doing it at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 23:07;0;0;They're *only* counting listening nodes, which are a minority.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 23:05;0;0;BDPL isn't all it's made out to be. It seems to be severely flawed.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 21:48;0;0;None of them are even trying to count non-listening nodes.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 14:46;0;0;Everyone has to trust the issuer. That's inherent in what it is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 14:44;0;3;What you're saying is that they DON'T. But that doesn't support a claim that they CAN'T.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 14:39;0;0;Typically by spinning up thousands of bogus nodes on cloud servers.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 14:39;0;1;Issuers CAN.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 14:37;0;1;Seriously? Where have you been? Did you miss Classic, 2X, etc doing that very thing (attacking node counts)?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 14:20;0;0;Quite often, if you show your adversaries your strategy, they will defeat you.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 14:03;0;0;That's up to the would-be reviewers. Find someone with a good reputation in the community who understands code, and ask them if they'd be willing to review it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 13:56;0;1;Nobody else is even *trying* to provide such numbers. You can't be wrong if you never make a claim...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 13:51;0;0;I never said that. There are, in fact, many people I would trust to review the code.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 13:46;0;0;Then clearly one of us would have miscounted. Perhaps in that case we could discuss our methodologies in private and figure out which one is wrong, and why.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 13:38;0;0;Figure out your own method of counting and compare your results.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 13:34;0;0;I claim it is accurate, and it also (hopefully) is objectively accurate. Neither of these properties require you to be able to verify that it is accurate. If you still don't get it, that's your problem. I'm done with this discussion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 13:24;0;0;In this case, nobody else is even TRYING.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 13:23;0;0;You're making an unreasonable black and white statement. What good is open source code if it doesn't do something useful?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 13:22;0;0;But it IS in fact accurate, so it's not a problem that people advertise it as such. It's that simple.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 13:13;0;0;"In this case, we already know everyone else"" have the wrong numbers. Your logic is also not sound.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 13:12;0;0;I'd be happy to provide the code privately to other parties I trust not to game the algorithm, to review and/or run their own instance.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 13:11;0;0;You can trust me or not. That's up to you. At this time, there is no way to get accurate + verifiable. Verifiable is worthless without accurate, so I prefer to keep it just accurate.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 13:10;0;0;If I tell you how many screws there are in the Tokyo Tower, my statement may be accurate or not. Whether you are able to go verify its accuracy, is an unrelated matter. Your inability to verify it does not necessarily make the claim inaccurate.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 13:04;0;0;Regardless, there isn't a *better* node count out there. Verifiability is less important than accuracy and relevance.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 12:59;0;0;Not if it ceases to be better once published...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 12:48;0;0;Probably not, other than figuring out a reliable way to count nodes yourself and comparing. It wouldn't do me any good if they weren't truthful, though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 12:16;1;1;The primary purpose for which I maintain these statistics is to keep me informed about the network. If others want to make use of it themselves, that's cool, but reliability is my goal here, not transparency.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 12:15;0;1;It is what it is. IMO it is better to have good data that relies on secret algorithms, than to not have good data at all. I'm not going to go into details on how to game my stuff.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 12:03;0;4;"Your phony pope"" Francis is fake news.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 11:33;0;1;You also can't prove you broadcasted it to miners of a decentralised blockchain. But as soon as Bob sees your claim of censorship (necessary for part 2 of the audit process), he also sees the transaction, and can apply it immediately and acknowledge the transfer in time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 11:30;0;0;Non-listening nodes are not really reachable at all. But all nodes, whether reachable or not, contribute to the network's consensus security by their users' enforcement of the rules on payments to them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 11:29;0;0;No, the logic to calculate node counts accurately could be gamed if known. For that reason, code is only available for audit by people I can trust not to abuse it in such a manner.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 11:26;5;79;Roger lies. This is not news. I'm not going to sift through all his garbage just to deny each and every random lie he comes up with. That'd be a waste of time. People are just going to have to learn to apply critical thinking, and reject claims without reasonable evidence.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 11:25;0;0;Sorry, I don't buy into the idea that hardforks are impossible.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 11:23;0;5;If you really think that, you don't have a good understanding of Catholic doctrine, and should go read pre-V2 popes and study how the Church interpreted their writings.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 11:18;0;3;"Yes. Because it's not the security you really own: it's the right to dividends, or something else of that nature. The dividends are paid by a centralised entity. If they say we're not going to recognise that transaction"", it doesn't matter if it was on a blockchain.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 11:16;0;2;You can still audit censorship with a decentralised system: just show a signed transaction transferring your shares to Joe, and demand the issuer show that either: they acknowledge Joe's shares, OR a signed transaction from Joe (for the same shares) to someone else.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 11:14;0;0;There's a reason why decentralised sidechains have become non-viable, whereas federated sidechains are a (at least relatively) secure option...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 11:13;0;0;That assumes there is an incentive for decentralised miners to protect your asset, that centralised ledgers can't be *distributed* better than decentralised miners (which today is pretty bleak), etc...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 11:10;0;0;There's no reason the issuers can't know who holds the shares, nor any reason the issuer awareness can't be limited to an obfuscated payment token (eg, a Bitcoin stealth address).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 04:07;0;10;I never really heard his Bitcoin sales pitch first hand, only witnessed the later fallout of people he sold on Bitcoin getting mad when it didn't do things Bitcoin was never expected or intended to do.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 04:06;0;1;(Note that such a centralised database can still support atomic trades where the counterparty is paying with a blockchain-based currency.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 04:04;3;23;Securities are inherently centralised by their nature. There is no point to having a decentralised ledger for them. Whatever entity they are already centralised with should just run an efficient database to track ownership.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 01:30;1;34;You say that as if it's a new development? Yet it seems he was making stuff up all along when he started promoting Bitcoin [as something it's not];;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.05.2018 00:10;0;1;Sure. I'm just saying it wouldn't be a surprise if he ended up converting to Catholicism eventually.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 23:52;0;1;Dunno. I wouldn't be totally shocked if Burke came around one day.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 23:46;0;0;"It's de fide; it is above Canon Law. And as already pointed out, 1917 Code reaffirms it.";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 22:14;0;1;Yes, there is, I already cited it for you yesterday. And we're not talking about suspected heresy - we're talking about PUBLIC/MANIFEST heresy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 22:12;0;0;Have you stopped beating your wife yet?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 22:11;0;1;No, it doesn't indicate that. All it indicates is that either you don't understand it, or you are dishonest. Nobody has claimed to be able to dethrone a pope, or that laity can declare heresy. The antipopes you defend were also never sitting.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 22:02;0;2;It's not an argument, in any case.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 21:58;0;2;Also, an ad hominem is when you attack/insult the speaker, and ignore the actual argument, which is exactly what you've been doing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 21:57;0;2;Except I *don't* deny it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 21:56;1;4;The V2 antipopes were never sitting popes, the teaching that heretics can't become popes is explicit that no declaration of the heresy is needed for the impediment, and finally, the only one to make an official declaration that an antipope wasn't pope, was Bp. Thuc (not a layman);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 21:51;1;5;There have been zero bishops of Rome after Pius XII.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 21:45;0;1;Succession to the chair of Peter (ie, becoming pope) is exactly what is in question here.

LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 21:29;1;6;The Church didn't defect. Just lost control of Vatican City and most buildings. There's a difference.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 21:29;1;4;Nope, the Church has additional criteria beyond a mere election.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 21:24;0;2;Nope, we don't deny that either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 21:14;0;1;You realise there's a difference between a nation and the Church, right?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 21:14;0;3;Truth is first and foremost known through reason, and the claim that Francis is pope is entirely irrational.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 20:58;0;2;I take antipope Michael's claim more seriously than I take Francis's. I would call anyone an antipope who meets the definition: someone claiming to be a pope who isn't in reality.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 18:00;1;4;It's not possible to prove a negative. It is simply a historical fact that the conditions the Church has set down for succession to the Holy See have not been met. The burden of proof lies with the one(s) claiming it has.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 17:18;0;2;No, we don't. You are slandering us with lies.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 17:18;0;3;No, it isn't. Nobody who assents to the Catholic Faith and observes reality as it is without any preconceived biases, would observe that there have been any publicly-visible bishops of Rome after Pope Pius XII.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 00:32;0;2;Let me work out some better details first. Might be a month or two.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 00:23;0;2;Francis isn't a bishop at all, much less bishop of Rome.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 00:22;0;3;No, Francis isn't a pope nor even a Catholic. He denies the Catholic religion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 00:13;0;4;"Sedevacantists"" is just a slur for faithful Catholics, similar to the older ""papists"". We are absolutely in communion with the Church of Rome. https://dashjr.org/catholic/sedevacantist.php …""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 00:12;0;1;When was that part of the definition? I've never seen it defined with such a criteria. Anyway, call them what you want - they're not popes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.05.2018 00:08;0;2;The FSSP is not Catholic, and not in union with the popes. But it is true that being in communion with the [real] popes is crucial to our salvation.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 23:59;0;1;"You do realise roman pontiff"" is just another word for ""pope"", right? And that the Church of Rome is (at least in this context) the same thing as the pope?""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 23:58;0;1;I just answered that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 23:56;1;2;They don't. Catholic clergy all denounce him as a heretic and outside the Church. Laymen who pretend to be popes are still antipopes. There is no requirement of being validly ordained to be an antipope.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 23:52;0;1;(The real popes, mind you, not the phonies you follow.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 23:50;0;1;To interpret Vatican II, look to Paul VI, JP2, and their magisterium. To interpret Satis Cognitum, look to Pope Leo XIII and the magisterium under him. And so on...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 23:49;0;1;Yes, Bishop Sanborn is in communion with all the popes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 23:48;1;4;"Francis doesn't rule the Church. He holds no office in the Church (only perhaps the civil office of monarch of Vatican City). He is an antipope because he fraudulently claims to be pope (that's what antipope"" means).""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 23:46;0;2;Bishop Sanborn is the founder of the Catholic seminary in Brooksville, Florida where I bring my family to Mass every week.

LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 23:41;0;2;I see, so your position is that Pope Paul IV teaches error officially, but Wikipedia is infallible?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 23:40;0;1;Is there a plain text version online somewhere?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 23:38;0;0;Bitmain *only* has an advantage if we give them one (by making it ASIC-resistant). An ASIC-friendly PoW levels the field.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 23:34;0;1;Also, the quotes shouldn't be sufficient proof alone. You can't just interpret them how you wish - Catholics must accept the authoritative interpretation of the Church.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 23:22;0;0;"I'm not aware of one. Catholic doctrine says it can't be either of them. (It wouldn't contradict the Faith to claim Pope"" Michael is, but a small ""conclave"" of laity just doesn't seem to fit the bill...)""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 23:20;0;1;Here's a summary. To confirm, read the original documents referenced, and observe how the Church interpreted them historically. http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/SSPX_QA_RevPDF2.pdf …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 23:14;0;0;Because any algorithm can have ASICs made. Making it harder just gives a bigger advantage to someone like Bitmain;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 23:12;0;1;Francis is not a Roman pontiff, however.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 23:12;0;1;It was on the agenda for Vatican [1], but the council was terminated early. That a heretic cannot *become* pope was formally defined by Pope Paul IV, however.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 23:02;0;3;That Francis is a public heretic, and per Catholic doctrine cannot be a pope under any circumstances.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 22:59;0;2;The laity at least probably have a good excuse for their ignorance, but that doesn't change the objective fact.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 20:28;0;1;ASIC resistance is not a goal/desirable. What we need is something where lots of people can make chips easily. There are plenty of viable candidates for that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 20:27;0;0;That wouldn't be a hardfork. It would be an altcoin.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 18:23;0;1;Don't forget BCH has the rapid difficulty adjustment logic. They can move a large amount of hashrate to an attack and still keep their network functioning.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 18:14;0;0;To change PoW, we need consensus in the economy. There's no rational reason why ticker would change or price would drop from a PoW change (but markets don't tend to be entirely rational).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.05.2018 15:51;0;0;Killing an innocent child is NEVER justifiable. And no government has the authority to legalise it. Failure to prosecute murder of children is negligence, and protecting the murderers is nothing more than abuse of power, like any street gang or mafia.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 23:50;0;0;Only this aspect of the network. There is more to the bigger picture, of course.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 23:49;0;0;Being able to exclude MaliciousMinerA can never damage anyone other than MaliciousMinerA...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 23:47;0;2;Well, centralised networks have a different kind of security (since only the chosen centralised operators can hijack them, not any random entity that gets 51%). But I wouldn't say it's really comparable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 23:46;0;0;Why not? $100/year isn't a big problem.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 23:29;0;0;Yes, that was the plan since at least 2011...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 23:28;0;0;Both is better than one.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 23:28;0;1;Probably would end up on BCH + Namecoin or such. Not our problem, although tbh it is nice to know the good miners wouldn't be left entirely stranded.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 19:04;0;1;Ideally, we'd use one of the algorithms that enables anyone to compete. Or we could try the anti-ASIC approach (which IMO is doomed to failure, but I'd rather do *something* than nothing at all...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 19:01;0;0;No, the intent has always been to make it impossible to perform such an attack.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 18:53;0;1;"To the first part, I agree. But the second part does not follow from it. Small blocks enable more users; big blocks make it harder for people to become users.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 18:52;0;3;It doesn't. It gets us one PoW change without losing all our friendly miners. Maybe two, if they build in two sufficiently-different variants. But that's better than none at all. And future ASICs they produce once we've decided to change could be only the variant + another.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 18:49;1;5;No, it doesn't. You just allow all the non-malicious variants.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 18:25;0;17;Haha, that troll @ ColetteWillis1 blocked me.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 18:12;0;0;Anyone developing mining ASICs can and should plan/design for a PoW change. It's trivial for them to do.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 18:09;0;1;I'm not a hardware expert. But some people I know who *are* seem to have even higher hopes for a better PoW change solution than I've seen discussed publicly so far (as well as being more optimistic about the consensus needed to deploy it, than I am).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 17:51;0;0;Don't see any useful technical info there.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 17:49;0;2;Indeed, I almost wonder if that should really be the first concrete step of a PoW change... have people crowdfund the production of the ASICs by buying them (probably even having them delivered) before the change is even made.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 17:48;0;0;I don't follow the sizes of Ethereum stuff personally... all I get in that area is what I read from others who mess with it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 17:46;0;1;So processing the 80 GB can generate the 1 TB?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 17:41;0;0;I'm talking about data downloaded and validated, not stored. Unless you check the ENTIRE history, you have not fully validated the whole chain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 17:39;0;0;With that low a percentage, a secret 2X/NYA attack would have a not-unlikely chance of succeeding...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 17:35;0;0;Under 2 weeks, to sync and validate the entire >1 TB Ethereum blockchain?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 17:34;0;0;"That's my estimate of where a surprise attack along the lines of 2X""/NYA would become infeasible.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 17:32;0;0;Random *what*?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 17:31;0;0;I would be shocked. Last I heard, it took MONTHS to sync such a node from scratch.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 17:27;0;0;For a healthy decentralised network, it should be the recipients of at least somewhere around 85% of economic activity.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 17:26;0;0;You're not making sense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 17:25;0;0;Better nodes don't necessarily imply better efficiency. IIRC, even with SHA2 people are finding that out.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 17:09;0;0;That assumes a better ASIC than the obvious ASIC can be produced. The goal for a new PoW algorithm ideally would be one where the best ASIC is the most obvious and easily made ASIC.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 16:59;0;0;(Possibility of PoW change is exactly that economic pressure.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 16:58;0;0;You don't need the latest semiconductor nodes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 16:58;0;0;There is no benefit to having only one or a few miners... Bitcoin was meant to be mined by so many people that conspiracies were impractical (much less a single entity just arbitrarily deciding).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 16:46;0;0;Uh, what? I'm not defending Bitmain by any stretch of the imagination...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 16:45;0;0;I don't know. I block a lot of trolls and altcoin pumpers on Twitter, and there's no RES to help me keep track of why exactly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 16:39;0;0;Tell him to use incognito mode. (Or alternatively he can stop pumping altcoins on unrelated threads, and I might unblock him...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 16:37;0;0;Make it easy for anyone else to compete.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 16:29;0;0;Likely.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 16:29;1;5;No, step 3 is possible for any number of blocks, once you have >50%.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 16:23;0;11;XRP is by default already Bitcoin's worst case scenario. Shoo scamcoiner.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 16:22;0;3;ASICs aren't a problem. So long as many people can make ASICs just as easily and efficiently as Bitmain, we have a good shot of a fair market.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 16:06;0;0;Hopefully GMO and Samsung aren't so incompetent as to make chips that don't support a PoW change...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 16:05;0;1;No, the past doesn't contradict me. I see you couldn't even come up with a single example to try to claim either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 16:03;5;81;In other words, half of the people present were frauds who are so screwed up that they support an ongoing massacre?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 16:00;0;0;Don't know what you're talking about. Scamcoins are not comparable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:59;0;0;The network wasn't broken without Segwit.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:59;0;0;"The only way it gives space"" for other players to join the network, is if we change the PoW algorithm. In which case, it makes no sense to wait for Bitcoin to lose value - we should just do it.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:57;0;0;No, there are plenty of ways such a large miner could profit from such an attack.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:56;0;0;The worst case scenario is that in the long run, we end up back where we are today, and still don't have other solutions. But even then, we still get a short term win.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:55;0;3;In other words, the worst case scenario of a PoW change, is that we get short term benefit, and long-term RETURN TO HOW THINGS ALREADY ARE NOW. There's no downside to this. We gain nothing by leaving the problematic situation as it is rather than at least TRYING.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:54;0;0;Not if you choose a PoW algorithm that's easy enough for anyone...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:53;0;0;You wouldn't necessarily see anything until it's too late. In theory, you might see >50% of the hashrate drop off the main network while they perform the attack, but that assumes Bitmain can't just manufacture more miners and use those for the attack instead (which they can).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:52;0;3;You'd have to search through BitcoinTalk for the original discussions, but this page has had it in the general advice since 2014: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_manufacturer_tech_guidelines#Things_to_do …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:43;0;0;Pools are nowhere near as big a problem.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:42;0;2;In the worst case scenario, it *might*, but it is far from certain that it would, and certainly isn't probable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:41;0;2;That fell apart for SHA2 when Bitmain figured out ASICBoost.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:40;6;22;For every miner you buy from Bitmain, you give them profits to put a couple more of the same online for themselves (but with ASICBoost enabled, so they get even more hashrate out of the same hardware than you can).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:40;5;17;No, I'm saying Bitmain has more hashrate themselves than everything they or anyone else has ever sold.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:39;0;1;Anything less than 100% is not a hardfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:36;0;0;(And AMD/Intel/Nvidia at least sell their hardware rather than running it themselves...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:35;1;3;Some algorithm that ASICs can be easily and cheaply made for by anyone.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:35;0;0;And that's what we'd get from a PoW change...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:34;0;0;LOL, Ripple isn't even close to the 2nd oldest...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:33;1;3;It can't really get any worse than what we have today...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:16;0;0;What negative consequences? There are none...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:15;2;2;Running a full node does nothing to prevent 51% attacks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 15:14;1;2;Hashrate as a number is much less meaningful than distribution of it. We would get a serious security boost from a PoW change today.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:56;0;0;It would also break the consensus system, and make it impossible for offline nodes to figure out which chain was correct.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:52;0;0;Ripple just embraces centralisation (our worst case scenario)... Not even comparable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:52;0;1;Maybe it would. But the goal of Bitcoin is not to merely disincentivise attacks. It is to make such attacks completely impossible (at least for a single or small group of entities).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:51;0;0;Looking for better options does not require leaving Bitcoin insecure until we find them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:50;0;0;Only Bitmain, right. I don't know how much of a disaster it would be for them, especially if they want to pump BCH...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:47;1;8;There are multiple tiers of decentralisation. Miner centralisation is pretty bad, but node centralisation would be even worse.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:45;0;2;We don't have any better options right now, and there is no downside. And full blocks isn't a problem, so it didn't need a solution at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:44;0;0;What percentage of the Ethereum economic activity do you think uses modes 0-5?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:40;1;8;Punishment is a good solution for many things.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:40;1;15;And that's not even counting the remote killswitch they've been caught putting in sold miners.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:39;3;8;They don't *only* build over 50%, but have control over quite a large amount (very likely >50%) as well.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:39;0;0;I mean what we call a full node for Bitcoin (block verification, or IDs 0-5 in your image).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:37;1;5;It seems pretty likely, yes. If Bitmain (or the Chinese government) or a close affiliate wanted to pay me, I would never consider it irreversibly confirmed (so long as the situation remains as it is).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:32;0;2;There's a limit to how much such deception can be successful.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:32;0;0;It's basically infeasible to run a (real) full node. But decentralised cryptocurrencies depend on a supermajority of the economic usage running full nodes of their own, for the network security. Without that, they are de facto centralised cryptocurrencies.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:29;3;11;False. Bitmain also controls most of the hardware directly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:29;0;4;If centralisation results in a PoW change (that harms centralising manufacturers), manufacturers are strongly incentivised to make sure they DON'T cause such centralisation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:28;0;0;Bitmain will have that advantage ONLY if it's ASIC-resistant. What we need is something that's so EASY to make an ASIC for, that small guys can compete with Bitmain fairly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:22;0;4;A reset will at the very least buy us time. It MIGHT also solve the problem long-term, by fixing the incentives so manufacturers don't try to centralise. Until a better solution can be found, we should at least go with what we CAN do today.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:21;1;2;Ethereum has even bigger problems, unfortunately.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:19;1;8;"Bitcoin (BTC) can be used as cash. Bitcoin Cash"" (BCH) is an altcoin that isn't even a year old yet, trying to squat on Bitcoin's name.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:19;6;23;There is 1 entity (Bitmain) that physically or legally controls a majority hashrate. That's a much worse problem. No cooperation needed even.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:10;0;0;Mining pools are no longer the biggest problem, sadly. Now it's come down to control of the actual hardware.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:09;1;4;"Bitcoin (BTC) was created as the very first cryptocurrency ever in 2009. Altcoins fraudulently trying to hijack the name began with Bitcoin XT"" in 2015, but these mostly never even launched. Launched altcoins trying to hijack the name began with ""Bitcoin Cash"" in 2017.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:05;2;14;3/ Bitcoin developers have been recommending ASICs have such a switch/mode since 2012, but to date I'm not aware of any manufacturer that has publicly answered if they actually did so. It's trivial to add, so I would HOPE they all do...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:04;2;9;"2/ At that time, all the non-malicious manufacturers (ie, sold widely) release information on their variant, and we make the new PoW algorithm be (for example) either CanaanSHA2 OR HalongSHA2 OR ..."".""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 14:04;2;10;1/ The ASICs need to be made with a switch to do a SHA2 variant in addition to normal SHA2. The manufacturer would keep the details of their variant secret until consensus is reached for a PoW change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 13:56;1;8;"So remove Bitcoin"" from the name...""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 13:55;1;12;Those are mining pools, not control of mining hardware, which has only gotten more and more centralised over the years.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 13:55;0;0;People get to see it if they follow/read the hashtags, but don't follow me.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 13:54;0;0;Why do people follow trolls like you? I'm curious.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 13:53;0;1;They've been PROVEN to have exactly such a backdoor TWICE now. And no, they probably have >50% even without this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 13:52;1;7;Fraudulently trying to pass it off as Bitcoin is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 13:52;1;25;Not with just a computer. You can buy miners from non-Bitmain (eg, @ canaanio and/or @ HalongMining) and/or support a PoW change to Bitcoin (but this requires consensus from the entire economy). Ideally, buy mining hardware that comes *prepared* for such a PoW change...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 13:50;0;13;Yet reality is proving this false.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 13:48;0;0;Why not?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 13:46;1;39;This was not an invitation to pump scamcoins.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 13:39;0;1;Go away, scammer.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 13:38;0;0;It does indeed seem that Bitmain has control of over 50% of operational hashrate hardware, either physical (which includes cloud mining operated by them) and/or legal (eg, foreign datacentres they own or own the hardware in). It's spread over multiple pools to give an illusion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 13:37;0;4;With less than 50%, there is a risk of such attacks that drops off rather quickly with the number of blocks, so you can be pretty confident in the security of a payment after N blocks. Ideally, I'd like to see <30% within a single government jurisdiction, and <10% per entity.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 13:34;11;68;It has a security assumption that mining is not centralised. In other words, centralised mining BREAKS the security assumptions of the whitepaper completely, and it is NOT intended to be secure under these conditions.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 13:26;0;1;Nothing is going to fix that other than making people more clueful.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 13:23;129;383;PSA: if someone has a full >50% hashrate for your cryptocurrency, there is NO NUMBER of blocks where confirmation is safe. Once you get beyond 50%, you can reverse an unlimited number of blocks! (What happened to BGold, CAN be done to BCH or maybe Bitcoin if Bitmain wants to...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 13:15;0;0;"@ ow we have…stopped providing service to EU…residents until further notice."" You said: ""This doesn't absolve you of complying with GDPR.""

LukeDashjr;25.05.2018 12:11;0;1;Sure, they should simply give you your own data, and let you decide how you will share it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.05.2018 23:52;0;0;"That would indicate something very wrong with the GDPR ;)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.05.2018 23:28;0;2;Pretty sure I've been advocating for a PoW change longer than Cobra has been using Twitter...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.05.2018 23:27;0;2;Blockchain-based solutions are usually NOT a good idea, especially for information that ought to be kept private.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.05.2018 20:25;0;0;Time to act was a while ago. Sadly, Bitmain has FUD'd half the community into thinking PoW change is somehow bad or scary.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.05.2018 17:44;9;25;If new privacy regulations require changes to company(s) privacy policies, it indicates there is something very wrong with either the regulations or those companys. On a wide scale, either the regulations or corporate society in general...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.05.2018 07:31;1;6;More like because of capitalism and patents tbh.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.05.2018 23:43;0;2;I wasn't asking, I was stating. Larger blocks are a BAD thing. BCH is no faster than Bitcoin. The new opcodes are useless. Etc;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.05.2018 23:27;0;1;Premature adoption based on false claims is not useful.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.05.2018 21:36;0;2;We began working on Bitcoin before Roger had even heard of it. We didn't start with segwit;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.05.2018 18:33;0;3;BCH is not superior in *any* way...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.05.2018 06:06;0;0;Of course, Linux runs on basically anything.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 21:33;0;0;To say Francis is a pope, is to implicitly deny Catholic doctrine. There is no rational basis to claim to be a Catholic and also claim Francis is or even can be a pope.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 21:29;0;4;Number of data centers doesn't matter. Physical and legal control does. And we're already down to 1 (Bitmain) with over 50%.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 21:19;0;0;No, it isn't better. Today, pools are merely a distraction from the reality that the hardware clustering is almost all under a single entity's control.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 20:48;0;2;Non-outsourcable mining doesn't result in everyone solo mining. It results in everyone cloud mining, which is the worse problem we actually have today.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 19:07;0;1;SHA2 has gotten *worse* with time, not better.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 19:06;1;1;That was the problem in 2013. The problem now is that there is only a few owners of most of the hash power in the first place.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 18:44;0;1;In other words, nothing but FUD.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 18:18;0;2;Someone asked a question, and I simply answered that financially, I would probably have more in those circumstances. That doesn't imply I'm dissatisfied with what I do have, nor even that I wish I had more. (Although I could certainly put more to good use...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 18:13;0;7;It's not that merge mining is bad, or that RSK is bad. Both are pretty good IMO. The problem is simply that miners are centralised.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 18:07;0;2;n.b. Larger block sizes are INFERIOR tech.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 18:04;0;3;I didn't say everyone will be forced to use it. Only that the reason for developing Bitcoin won't go away by people using something inferior.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 17:54;0;0;Are you a troll? Why should I have to make a statement about every account that isn't mine?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 10:15;0;1;BCH isn't Bitcoin at all, much less its future. You have no idea how decentralised cryptocurrency works, go troll somewhere else.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 10:15;0;28;What are you, a troll? I am part of the Bitcoin community just like everyone else who cares about and uses Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 09:25;0;7;The Bitcoin community, obviously.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 08:42;0;2;BCH isn't Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 08:06;0;3;You could do an equivalent system with a simple SQL database and achieve much greater scalability with less resource usage.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 07:58;0;4;Not really. BCH as-is is a mere centralised system, with an inefficient design.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 07:52;0;0;Teleportation is a LOT harder of a problem than people seem to give it credit for.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 07:50;0;14;Bitcoins on sidechains. Pegging in and out is slow and costly, so whenever possible it makes more sense to atomic swap.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 07:26;0;21;1) LOL, you wish. Don't forget: we survived MtGox. 2) Again, price and relative adoption level are irrelevant. Bitcoin remains the better tech.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 07:18;0;4;To be clear, I am referring to adoption of Bitcoin alone. I am not comparing it to altcoins, and do not care how much adoption altcoins do or don't get.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 07:16;8;105;"I don't see BCH overtook BTC"" as something that can meaningfully happen in reality. Even if its price were better, it would still make more sense to work on and use Bitcoin.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 07:15;0;7;The biggest barrier to a PoW change is the FUD the community suffers from currently. It doesn't make sense to put a lot of technical work into it until we've at least made some progress overcoming the FUD aspect.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 06:33;9;117;Adoption is so far ahead for Bitcoin that it's not something we need to concern ourselves with. So long as we regain decentralisation and make it capable of the features people need, adoption will come on its own.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.05.2018 06:32;0;2;By the way, the latest # TalosII firmware from @ RaptorEng finally gets the noise level down.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.05.2018 09:20;0;9;Meh, fraud shouldn't give it special treatment.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.05.2018 08:11;0;1;In other words, has little (if anything) to do with Segwit.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.05.2018 08:11;0;2;Not substantially different from the rest of the scamcoins that have been going on since 2011.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.05.2018 02:14;2;3;I know this first hand FWIW. It's not just a rumour.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.05.2018 01:07;0;4;That's what it's supposed to do...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.05.2018 00:21;0;0;(This is a scam/phishing website!);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.05.2018 00:17;0;1;The standards for evidence you are asking for are impossibly high, and you would not believe anything other than mathematics if you demanded this level of evidence for it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 20:06;0;2;1) Developers have no power in Bitcoin, 2) Blockstream only pays a small minority of developers, and 3) Even those paid by Blockstream, aren't controlled by Blockstream.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 19:07;0;0;Obviously not. We've already been at that point for a while, and consensus hasn't shifted.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 18:38;0;0;On success, nothing - it actually costs less than to mine it legitimately. each time they fail, up to 75 BTC (possibly less if you do the math and optimise).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 18:18;1;1;With Lightning or decentralised sidechains, they can outright steal funds from channels/pegs too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 18:17;0;1;BCH doesn't yet. That's my point. I hope they carve out a use case for themselves, but being no better than PayPal isn't going to get them there.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 18:16;0;2;"If the original Bitcoin survives, then there was no hardfork at all, merely an altcoin. The only time there is a hardfork, is when the original one changes itself (and therefore there is only one survivor"").""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 18:15;0;0;"Hmm, so he sees it as an optional thing, not a requirement? I'm not actually sure if Islam might leave it optional like that - perhaps he's right. Still, it wouldn't make sense to claim those who opt-in to be more extreme"" than ""real Muslims"".""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 18:04;0;0;If Bitmain was actually only 30%, that might have been a viable suggestion, but in reality they are likely still over 50%, which no amount of blocks confirmed is safe from.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 13:35;0;1;https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/pos.pdf Also, mining is not about coin distribution.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 13:32;0;0;No, it isn't. BTG is a completely different currency. A hardfork / PoW change would be the same currency.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 13:16;0;0;BTG is an altcoin, not Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 10:59;0;1;People have tried to raise children as the opposite sex from birth, and it turns out disastrous.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 06:31;0;0;Something bad is already here.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 06:27;0;0;No, Bitmain physically controls the hashrate. It isn't just pointed at their pools.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 06:06;0;1;And notice that the community reacted to the http://Ghash.io situation and took it away from them. Yet in this case, you're advocating NOT taking it away from Bitmain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 06:04;0;0;http://GHash.io was just a mining pool. They didn't physically have >50% under their control.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 05:57;0;0;You can't get a larger cut than 100%. And the only reason Bitmain isn't 100% is because they choose to be (insignificantly) less.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 05:54;0;0;Less and less actually, and it *can* grow indefinitely. Not only would a warranty of PoW algo be inappropriate, it also wouldn't help since it is trivial for them to prepare for.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 05:44;0;0;That's FUD. New competitors can trivially prepare for a PoW change. They should do that anyway even when it isn't likely to happen.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 05:26;0;0;Maybe not if someone comes up with a perfect PoW change proposal that solves other issues too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 05:18;0;0;It's been getting worse for years. The question should be why you think this trend will reverse.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 04:35;0;0;No, your chance is 1/8 each time. Failure does not improve your future chances. (It would however be correct to say you have a 50/50 chance to succeed at some point if you try a total of 4 times.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 04:22;0;0;The math is in the original whitepaper: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 03:59;0;2;PoW change is not as big of a deal as FUDders try to make it out to be. It's relatively minor, for a hardfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 03:59;0;1;It's actual SHA2 miners that are centralised. Bitmain controls a majority of SHA2 hashrate, and not just via pools.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 02:28;0;0;Nope, that's how bad the situation really has gotten.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 02:24;0;0;You prefer no security at all? Because that's where we're at today.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 02:03;0;0;No;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 02:02;0;0;No, it wouldn't. There's also no invalid tx involved...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 01:58;0;1;Depends on what those institutions are, at the very least...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 01:57;0;19;You were out in public?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 01:35;0;0;With a new PoW, anyone can mine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 01:07;0;2;zk-SNARK transactions can be done with a softfork. No reason to complicate a hardfork with it. Unless you mean hiding the amounts... that might make sense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 00:59;0;0;That has nothing to do with this topic...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.05.2018 00:58;1;1;Hash rate of different algorithms is not at all comparable. They're completely different things. What can be compared, however, is diversity of miners. SHA2 is centralised (= terrible diversity), whereas any new algorithm we switch to would be decentralised.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 22:21;0;0;Get a calculator and do the math. Then you have proof of it. Pretty much any other hash algorithm would solve it because Bitmain would lose their advantage.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 22:15;0;0;https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/997717910914240512 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 22:15;0;0;Did you even read the tweet you're replying to?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 22:07;0;0;They're not parameters, just probability of success.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 22:05;0;1;Sure, that's not what I'm talking about obviously. For that scenario, you can skip all the light node stuff and just have a remote wallet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 22:04;0;0;BTG is an altcoin, not Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 22:03;0;1;"Just because it would be safe to have a single decentralised pool with 100% of the hashrate doesn't mean it's a good idea. Modularity is also a good thing in general; bitcoind is a node, not mining software.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 22:00;0;0;ASICs aren't centralisation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 20:16;0;0;I hope not. Light nodes is already a serious threat to Bitcoin. We should be trying to discourage it, not encourage.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 20:15;0;0;No, you need to run a full node for decentralised cryptocurrency period. With or without Lightning.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 20:05;0;0;No, the goal is ASIC-friendly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 20:05;0;0;Unconfirmed transactions aren't on-chain. A miner can certainly only spam their own blocks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 19:43;0;0;Do the math.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 19:36;0;1;And since it's N transactions, the fees can be higher...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 19:32;0;1;Lightning isn't entirely off-chain, and does pay fees to miners.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 19:29;0;3;It does need decentralised action to protect it, as has been proven multiple times by now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 19:24;0;1;Incentives. And if it re-centralises, we can change again and again until they don't do it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 19:23;0;0;Your scenario is the same as if people spend $5 on a meal + $2 in transaction fees, instead of $5 on transaction fees for a $2 meal. It's plainly ridiculous.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 19:21;0;1;I'm not entirely sure what exactly was used.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 19:21;0;3;Ok, I'm just going to block you again if you're going to be a troll.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 19:20;0;1;Go away, scammer.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 19:17;0;4;No, it doesn't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 19:06;0;4;Overwhelming consensus is the goal. Until then, nothing happens.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 18:56;0;0;Yes, in that scenario, both chains would have to be equally valid.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 18:51;0;3;With a hardfork, there is only one currency, not a new one.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 18:51;1;15;BCH is never Bitcoin at all. You should know better. Trolling again?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 18:50;0;0;No, selfish mining is something else. The 30% can reverse 6-blocks is just the math Satoshi documented as a known threat in the original whitepaper.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 18:36;0;0;No, it isn't certain that it will happen again. That's FUD.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 18:36;0;8;That implies we rely on their announcements. It's pretty obvious if nobody is able to mine, that someone else is doing that mining...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 18:31;0;1;Block size is already 2-4 MB...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 18:23;0;2;"It's a hardfork, so it has the usual hardfork side effects (needs consensus or fails; requires everyone upgrade; etc).";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 18:15;0;0;I'm not sure if those count, however, since they involved a protocol change and protocol violation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 18:15;1;2;The absolute ideal solution would be for Bitmain (and ideally anyone else with over 10% network hashrate) to physically liquidate to as many global customers as are willing to mine. Since that has not happened, we should be trying to grow consensus for a PoW change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 18:14;1;5;I know at one point he had over 50% direct control of operational/online hardware. Pools are less concerning than hardware control.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 18:11;0;2;I'd personally be surprised if it dropped to 40%.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 18:09;0;3;BTG is an altcoin, not a hardfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 18:02;0;1;Hopefully they're competent enough to design their chips to survive the PoW change. It's trivial for them to do so, and it's been the recommended advice since ASICs were first announced.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 18:02;1;7;1) We should pick an algorithm that has a low barrier of entry for others. 2) Bitmain can learn that the community will react defensively and change PoW, thus incentivising them not to do it again even if they can. 3) Worst case scenario, it happens again, and we change again.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:59;0;1;That's [part of] why SHA2 is broken. We need an unpatented/unpatentable PoW algorithm to fix this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:58;0;1;"It's not possible to ban the attack; it's inherent to how PoW works. It would be trivial for an ASIC manufacturer to make their chips able to (with community consent) survive a PoW change. Devs have recommended they do this since the very first ASICs.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:56;0;4;ASICs aren't the problem. We just need to ensure the new ASICs aren't centralised. And if they are, yes, we can PoW change again and again until they aren't. No harm in that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:55;0;1;When they succeed, zero (and whatever they gain from the attack is profit). When they fail, no more than 75 BTC each time (potentially cheaper, if they figure out the ideal point to give up and start over).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:52;0;3;PoS is not workable. Our only viable option at this time is a *different* PoW algorithm.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:52;0;0;It's the same math for any PoW system.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:52;0;1;Bitmain doesn't only manufacture. They also control.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:51;0;0;Because it's a problem we should address.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:51;0;0;1) Centralised mining is NOT security. 2) Bitmain is already malicious.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:50;1;1;Hashpower is already malicious.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:49;0;0;Yes, you do.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:49;1;6;Indeed. If Bitmain liquidated (to the point they had control of under 10% total) globally and not to merely a few other entities, the problem goes away. Note that mere legal ownership (where Bitmain retains physical control) is not sufficient, however.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:47;0;0;Awareness.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:46;0;1;This has nothing to do with RBF... And BCH is just as vulnerable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:45;0;0;Indeed. That's why the most successful schools have been geared toward teaching either men specifically, or teaching women specifically. Co-ed schools have dropped the general education level significantly in an attempt to treat both identically.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:43;0;0;"I think there's more to it than that. Our society punishes people who reach out for help by stripping them of their rights and locking them up in mental institutions to get help"" in the form of non-consensual and unproven drugs tested on them on a trial-and-error basis.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:42;0;1;No, just apparently not well-known anymore.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:41;0;0;Unlikely, but there are a lot of factors to make a conclusive and broad statement.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:40;0;0;It might. It might not. They should make their chips with a backup algorithm so they keep working when/if we change... It's trivial for them to do so.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:39;0;4;The cost is zero when you succeed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:38;0;0;Again, they can control. That's what selling miners does.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:37;0;6;Which is already the case now (remember that >50% is 100%).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:34;0;2;If the problem comes back, we can solve it again. It's not like PoW change is a one-time trick. And knowing this creates the incentive we need for miners not to recreate the problem.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 17:32;0;0;Not when the dishonesty results in no loss (as it currently does, because Bitmain called the bluff and the community refuses to act).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 13:04;0;0;"They could sell their miner to someone else. Besides, the goal isn't to be fair; it's to decentralise.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 13:00;0;2;It's not possible, no.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 12:55;0;2;Not when the details aren't materially relevant.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 12:52;0;1;"Calling PoW changes a nuclear option"" is just FUD. There is nothing nuclear about it.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 12:52;0;1;It was abused last year to try to block Segwit. No reason to think it won't be abused again.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 12:50;0;0;We can get that incentive without mining. The only purpose of mining/PoW in the first place, is to make it impossible.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 12:49;0;1;You get consensus for the concept first, then work on the details.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 12:38;0;1;But it IS broken.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 12:37;0;2;Maybe it won't be a race...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 12:35;0;3;We pick an algorithm that's simple, so more resources are no better than fewer resources...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 12:31;0;5;There's a reason nobody is discussing the details on which algo until we get consensus...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 12:29;0;4;The miners are supposed to be a large collective too big to secretly conspire together, not a single company and their subsidaries.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 12:25;0;1;The current situation IS an attack on Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 12:22;0;0;Why are those more wrong than forcing the network to trust them?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 12:15;0;1;Which is precisely the problem: nodes AREN'T responding. The way to respond would be a PoW change. Bitmain HAS done wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 12:14;0;1;That's what they want. They want Bitcoin to die and BCH to take over.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 12:10;0;1;The very ability of miners to do these things is itself an attack. And things really are this insecure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 11:54;0;0;You make no sense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 11:38;0;1;Bitmain already has SHA2...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 11:33;0;0;I personally wait for at least 10 these days. But that only reduces the threat, since the risk is infinite with Bitmain's >50%.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 11:26;0;0;Sounds like you're accusing me of being a dishonest person with no basis whatsoever.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 11:26;0;0;Without consensus, it is impossible to hardfork. Attempting to do so will only result in a new altcoin instead.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 11:19;0;1;The goal is a hardfork, not an alt.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 11:18;0;0;That would still be my goal if we can get consensus for it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 11:17;0;0;A PoW change is a hardfork. All it needs is consensus.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 11:14;0;0;With PoW blockchains, more than 50% literally is 100%.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:57;0;1;It has been a valid option for years.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:55;0;1;Depends on the PoW.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:55;0;0;Didn't say there was.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:38;0;0;"No, it's a rational one. Miners are defined by the PoW algorithm. When discussing what algorithm to use, the miners"" don't exist.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:31;0;0;You mean EX-miners. They're not a relevant party to the decision.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:29;1;21;Sounds like you might want something more like Ripple then. No need for the overhead of decentralisation and mining if you just want to trust an organization incentivised to behave in your interests.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:26;0;4;We need an algorithm that lots of entities can build and get it widely distributed. I think this is achievable, but it will take more R&D to be sure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:22;0;2;You assume the former *would* diminish Bitmain forever...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:12;0;5;PoW change accommodates more miners than status quo.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:11;0;5;Since Bitmain controls more than 50%, there is no number that would be secure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:10;0;5;It can't get any worse than it currently is...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:09;0;0;Miners don't matter. They can make the chain as long as they like, but if everyone refuses to use it, it's worthless. And since they have electricity bills to pay, they will eventually just switch to BCH instead.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:08;1;5;The worst case scenario with a PoW change is that nothing improves. It can't really get any worse.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:07;0;0;Stop pretending to be me, scammer.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:07;0;1;You assume 8 blocks will fix it, which it won't...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:06;0;1;Mining pools aren't the issue.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:06;0;2;I always found the code to be a mess. Someone should rewrite it in C/C++ IMO.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:05;0;0;No, it wouldn't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:05;0;15;That is not the security model Bitcoin was designed for.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:04;0;1;ASICs aren't the problem.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:04;0;0;Peak ASIC was years ago. Things have only gotten worse since then.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:03;0;0;If the Church were a human institution, you might have an argument. But it is led by God Himself, and men cannot change it. God will also guarantee its survival.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:02;0;5;Pools aren't the issue anymore. Bitmain controls too much hardware.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:02;0;0;No, I explained that the risk is there. I didn't explain how you would go about exploiting it. Some people can no doubt figure out how to do it (perhaps you're one of them).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:00;0;4;It depends on a lot of circumstances. In the next few months, probably very low, but with better education and R&D, who knows...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 10:00;0;3;Not only that, but since BCH is a thing, the miners would be fools to keep trying to mine the SHA2 Bitcoin chain when everyone else abandons it, rather than just switch to BCH.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 09:59;0;3;Yes, I don't consider someone with only 10% hashrate to be a serious security concern in itself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 09:58;0;8;And men don't think like women. The sexes compliment each other - one is not better than the other.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 09:57;0;1;Steal? They can take our insecure SHA2 hashes... no harm to us. It's win-win really: we get a better PoW algo, and they get our leftovers (which is still an improvement over their status quo).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 09:56;0;1;Contentious hardforks are impossible. They just spawn altcoins. We can only even try a real hardfork, if we get consensus for it first.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 09:56;0;3;PoW change would only improve security at this point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 08:47;31;86;This is why mining decentralisation is so important for # Bitcoin's security, and why we should be seriously considering a PoW change (only with community consensus of course).https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/997717910914240512 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 08:42;0;2;There's no inherent reason it can't be revived. Just needs miners to use it, I think. The bigger problem is that Bitmain has physical control over so much hashrate themselves.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 08:37;1;12;Any % always has *some* chance of any #of block reversal. The chance of success is just greatly diminished. For 12 blocks, 30% hashrate has a 1-in-44 chance. (Note that >50% hashrate has a 100% probability of success reversing any number of blocks, given enough time.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 08:35;0;4;Indeed, an attacker actually has an inherent advantage above and beyond this because honest miners have to coordinate with each other, whereas the attacker only coordinates with himself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 08:28;0;0;"Did you listen to my link? Not a one of these Chilean bishops"" were actually Catholic bishops to begin with.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 08:23;0;1;I think you may have hit a rounding error somewhere.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 08:20;0;19;ASICs aren't the problem, just centralisation of them. SHA2 ASICs *started with* competition, but Bitmain ruined that by breaking the algorithm. We can wait and hope (not rationally IMO), or we can act to get a better algorithm...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 08:14;2;22;The only fix is to decentralise mining. Hence the desire for a PoW change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 08:10;0;15;This isn't something that can be solved. It's why mining needs to be decentralised for Bitcoin to be secure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 08:09;4;17;Some people seem to be under the impression Bitcoin is safe so long as nobody has 51%, hence my pointing out that even 30% is a danger.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 08:08;0;20;Sure, but obscurity can help when the attack isn't entirely mitigated yet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 08:06;2;13;5000 for 6 blocks. Greg has a script to do the math here: https://people.xiph.org/~greg/attack_success.html …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 08:02;1;40;I don't think explaining to people how to attack Bitcoin is necessarily a good idea...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 07:57;84;284;PSA: Someone with even a mere 30% hashrate can REVERSE a 6-block confirmation, 1 out of every 8 attempts. And when they fail, it is undetectable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 07:48;0;2;Mining on them doesn't require a full node, so it's at least a similarly harmful protocol.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 07:44;0;1;Pooled mining and hosted mining both solve the problem of variance being too high. Solo mining is liable to not pay the bills at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 07:43;0;0;Yes, that's assuming 30% under a single entity's control. (Which stratum-based pools effectively do.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 07:42;0;0;https://people.xiph.org/~greg/attack_success.html …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 07:41;1;3;30% is sufficient hashrate to succeed at reversing 6 block confirmations, 1 in 8 attempts.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 07:37;0;0;It would push pooled miners into hosted mining, which is always worse. And pools aren't even bad in general, just *certain* pooling protocols are.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 07:36;0;5;This isn't entirely correct either. Even 30% is dangerous. (But again with the caveat that p2pool and similar pools are fine.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 07:35;0;0;Yeah, that doesn't stop hosted mining.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 07:34;0;2;If it was p2pool.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 07:34;0;1;Deprecating hosted mining services seems impossible so long as people are willing to completely trust the host, which has been shown to be true. Deprecating just pools would result in more hosted stuff, which is worse. In any case, pools aren't generally a problem. eg, p2pool.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 07:30;0;3;No evidence it didn't work AFAIK;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 07:29;0;1;I haven't seen any evidence it wasn't effective for XMR. Merely looking at pools is ignoring the real picture.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 07:27;0;4;By having many more people participate in mining...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 07:22;1;4;Pools are not the primary problem these days. Control of the hardware is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 07:09;0;2;Not since Halong, but before he had over 50%. I don't think Halong has shipped enough to significantly cut into Bitmain yet (keep in mind Canaan has been trying for years).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 06:38;0;5;This is only part of the big picture. We also don't want miners to become organised into border-spanning governments of their own through collusion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 06:33;2;8;The physical mining equipment is controlled by people. These days, most of it by a single person (Jihan). His government can certainly tell if he violates their commands.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 06:20;0;0;"As a Bitcoin maximalist"", I obviously don't consider that an acceptable solution. ";;;;;;https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/997693334008336384;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 06:16;1;8;Centralised mining will result in transactions being censored, whether miners have the incentive to do it or not. No matter where the miner(s) are located, they are subject to some government. The only way around this is decentralising mining so there's too many governments.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 06:14;0;2;And Christian wives never were. That troll is conveniently leaving out context: everyone without exception (men, women, leaders, etc) is subject to higher authorities. Obedience does not equate to slavery.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 06:11;0;4;The point of mining is to *avoid* trusting anyone, not to make a trusted entity/group that has incentives to behave.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 02:20;0;2;Miner centralisation defeats the entire purpose of mining. Might as well go back to the Fed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.05.2018 02:19;0;0;Used to. Got too expensive.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 23:26;0;1;Thanks... We'll need it;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 23:23;0;0;A hardfork is a protocol change to an existing cryptocurrency where previously invalid blocks become valid. Hence why it needs consensus. Bitcoin's last hardfork was in 2013.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 23:20;0;0;Nope.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 23:16;0;0;No such thing;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 23:14;0;0;BTG is an altcoin, not a hard fork;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 23:13;0;0;So when you have no arguments, you resort to ad hominem? Sounds like you're the one who has been corrupted...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 22:38;0;0;See, that's an example of FUD. It shouldn't, since they can and should prepare for a possible change even when one isn't needed (and especially when one is!);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 22:37;0;1;"Well, let's change that... Why don't you? Most of the arguments"" against are FUD spread by Bitmain.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 22:36;0;3;Hopefully not gridlock on unrelated changes though. Holding stuff hostage is no good for the network.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 22:34;0;1;Nobody did, that's why it isn't happening yet. Consensus building is step 1.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 21:50;0;9;Yes;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 19:15;0;1;Consensus hardforks aren't hostile anything. Now you're getting into the realm of FUD.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 19:05;0;0;Other manufacturers could make hardware for the new algorithm too - Bitmain would lose their advantage.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 19:01;0;0;It'd be better than our current situation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 19:00;0;4;"It's simply issued-by-bitmain; same reason Satoshi gave for not using IP addresses.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 18:58;0;2;SHA2 is completely broken as a PoW algorithm right now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 18:57;0;0;Because what we have now is still broken. Worst case, things don't improve.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 18:31;0;8;Centralised hashrate is mostly meaningless. BCH might get a little stronger, but Bitcoin would be so many more times secure, it wouldn't be harmful to us.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 18:24;0;0;Then why do they cower in fear every time someone suggests it?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 18:24;0;1;No, everyone will be able to mine with GPUs until new ASICs come out, and Bitmain won't have a monopoly over them this time around.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 18:19;0;0;You're completely wrong.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 08:10;0;1;It's certainly possible. And we'll probably get a working/permanent PoW eventually. PoS on the other hand shows no real hope of becoming viable. Maybe that will change eventually, but I wouldn't hold out hope for it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;18.05.2018 07:34;1;5;Nah. It's win-win. We get better security. They inherit our old miners (which is still an improvement for them).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;16.05.2018 05:30;0;0;That's part of the problem we need to overcome for Bitcoin to succeed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.05.2018 05:30;1;10;PGP isn't the problem...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.05.2018 05:14;0;0;Exactly;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.05.2018 05:14;0;0;So full node adoption must at least keep up with bitcoins currency adoption, basically.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.05.2018 05:13;0;0;50-85% of economic activity (transaction volume) need the recipient to verify his payment came in, using a full node he himself exclusively controls or can at least audit.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.05.2018 05:10;0;0;Bitcoin adoption has never needed help. I'm not worried about that. By zk-SNARKs, I mean to prove the entire chain history.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.05.2018 05:08;0;0;$10/year for unlimited transfers is nothing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.05.2018 05:07;0;0;Tech takes time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.05.2018 05:06;0;0;Full node security only works at 50-85% adoption. Any lower, and you end up with full nodes being less secure than non-full.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.05.2018 05:05;0;0;They're not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.05.2018 05:05;0;0;But you're still running it;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.05.2018 05:05;0;0;Eventually, bigger blocks will probably be needed, but delaying that as long as possible gets us a bigger user count practical. And maybe we'll get working zk-SNARKs in the meantime, which could enable another magnitude jump.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.05.2018 05:02;0;0;To maintain the current costs to use Bitcoin, block sizes would need to be 300-400k on average. What we need to scale is make on chain data per transaction smaller. That's where Lightning is a big step forward.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.05.2018 04:59;0;0;You don't. That's my point. BCH has rejected the concept of full nodes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.05.2018 04:56;0;0;1M is already too big for many people if we want a global currency.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.05.2018 04:56;0;0;You need to run Linux to benefit from it. Likewise, you need to run Bitcoin (aka a full node) to benefit from it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;16.05.2018 04:54;0;1;A chain without commerce has no value and will die as miners fail to pay their bills.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.05.2018 04:52;0;1;If Bitcoin miners decided to increase the block reward, their attempt would spawn a new altcoin, and Bitcoin would continue as-is (they did actually try this before, at the first subsidy halving).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.05.2018 18:21;0;0;That's simply not true;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.05.2018 04:09;0;0;It's just a difference in age. PayPal has been around longer, so has come to terms with its reality, whereas BCH is still pretending to be something it really isn't.

LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 21:29;0;0;He was one of the minority of the devs who didn't think BIP148 had enough support.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 21:23;0;3;Don't imply true statements are anything but, just because you were wrong, please.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 19:32;0;2;There was almost zero support for 2X in general, and absolute zero from active Core devs.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 18:42;0;0;Not necessarily. It might, since it typically carries the accidents of wine, but it really isn't wine, so it might not. Regardless, blood alcohol measurements aren't how drunkenness is defined.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 18:35;0;2;AFAIK, the definition of drunkenness relevant to the moral subject is when you lose your capacity to reason or mental barriers for avoiding sin. As far as the Mass goes, it ceases to be wine at consecration regardless.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 18:12;0;2;Seems like you can't remember that lying refers only to *false* statements...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 17:47;0;5;I've always wondered how practical it would be to try to combine body armor with a big battery...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 17:42;0;3;In luggage... It doesn't say if you can wear it. :/;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 17:22;3;16;Most Core devs supported BIP148. Also, in principle, almost all of us support UASF - the only matter of real disagreement was whether BIP148 had sufficient support (which it clearly did in hindsight);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 10:48;0;0;Now you're just trolling. Bitcoin has a whitepaper. It's BCH that doesn't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 10:43;0;0;You have it backward. Bitcoin is p2p, but not BCH. BCH is run by an administrator/miner.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 10:35;0;8;There is only one Bitcoin. BCH is not it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 10:35;0;0;Read the linked thread;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 10:14;0;1;Lies like this are just fraud. BCH is not Bitcoin at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 10:14;0;0;Bitcoin has always supported both irreversible and reversible payments. But that's an unrelated topic..;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 10:13;0;1;Pretty sure PayPal and credit cards (which more or less provide the same level of services as BCH) have lower fees. If not, they certainly will long-term unless BCH comes out with some breakthrough(s).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 08:25;1;22;Also, it's actually BCH that is going in the direction of a central bank.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 08:24;1;30;Why are you misrepresenting us with this lie? I simply stated a fact that unconfirmed transactions are less secure than credit cards. You don't have to like that fact, but it is still nevertheless a fact.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 08:07;0;0;Depends on your administrator/miner's mood at the time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 07:50;0;0;"It's not irrelevant. It is deceptive for the reasons I already explained. Zero confirmations"" means ""confirmed (0 blocks deep)"", but it's NOT confirmed.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 07:37;0;0;"Except confirmations"" are not a thing, just shorthand.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 02:14;0;31;Consensus? You're not going to be part of this year's NYA2 altcoin initiative are you?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 02:12;0;4;Preying*;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.05.2018 02:05;0;5;"Sometimes the way they make the burgers, you get the impression you almost have to eat it with the peel"" to avoid a mess...""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.05.2018 01:32;0;11;"zero confirmation"" includes the word ""confirmation"", which implies they are in some sense confirmed. Consider that ""one confirmation"" is shorthand for ""confirmed, one block deep"".""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.05.2018 11:10;0;1;But at the same time, we do NOT currently have enough full nodes to keep the network secure. The goal there should be 85% of all (bitcoin) economic activity having the receiver running his own full node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.05.2018 11:09;0;1;If we didn't have enough listening nodes, it wouldn't be practical to connect a node that had been previously offline (new or otherwise). So there's definitely enough for the current userbase. For global adoption, we may very well need more.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.05.2018 10:58;0;0;No, all that matters to you is your own node, and the nodes of people you want to pay. Whether those nodes are listening or not is irrelevant. There is *some* need of listening nodes, but it's not nearly as important as that people are using full nodes at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.05.2018 10:41;0;0;Bitnodes only shows listening nodes. Most aren't listening.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.05.2018 10:41;0;4;Nope. You just broadcast your tx-to-merchant to the merchant or a proximate peer so they and their nearby nodes get that first, and at the same time broadcast another tx double spending it to the miners. It might not be 100% success rate, but there's zero cost to attempting it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.05.2018 10:39;0;0;No, that's my point exactly: you're *not* going to recover the $3 when someone scams you with an unconfirmed transaction. But at least if he paid with a credit card, you have a chance that the scammer will lose his ability to scam at some point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.05.2018 10:37;0;2;Lightning is just as much a blockchain tx as unconfirmed transactions are.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.05.2018 07:00;0;2;Unconfirmed transactions are riskier because usually you don't even know the guy's name, and to argue your case, you'd need to file a lawsuit. With credit cards, at least there's *some* risk to a serial scammer.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.05.2018 05:47;0;2;If you don't need security, why not just use credit cards?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.05.2018 04:33;0;2;I personally don't, but so long as one doesn't intentionally get drunk, drinking is fine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.05.2018 04:31;0;2;I've certainly been wrong before (but @ mongoosenewyork is just a troll).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.05.2018 04:30;0;4;Any proof leaving your email login info at a public library as a vector of attack? Because that's pretty much the same kind of thing... Unconfirmed transactions were never designed to be nor intended to be safe - that's WHY we have a blockchain at all!;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;11.05.2018 00:29;0;0;You can't know what the hashrate has accepted.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.05.2018 00:01;0;1;RBF has no impact on security of unconfirmed transactions. Implying it does is deceptive.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.05.2018 22:59;11;71;"And what's super ironic is that BCH is all everything should be on-chain! off-chain is evil!""... and then they go push off-chain transactions like this as a feature XD (In case it isn't obvious: unconfirmed transactions are off-chain";;;;;;https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/994683299590299650;;
LukeDashjr;10.05.2018 22:56;9;70;"It's really telling that BCH's idea of innovation"" is ""take something insecure, don't change it, and falsely advertise it as secure"".""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.05.2018 22:53;13;114;"True zero-conf is Lightning. BCH's zero-conf"" is really just deceptively trying to imply that UNCONFIRMED transactions are in some way confirmed, when they're not at all.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.05.2018 21:39;0;0;No, it doesn't. Learn the difference between legitimate authority and abuse of power.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.05.2018 21:38;0;0;Mothers have an obligation to care for their children, regardless of age. Claiming this obvious moral principle is absurd, is what is really absurd.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.05.2018 19:13;0;1;"What security-conscious project isn't? ;)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 10:39;0;1;lolwut?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 09:46;0;2;Decentralisation is only really a means to a goal (trustlessness). It doesn't do you much good if you bring trust in through a back door like this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 09:46;0;0;And you end up with a trust-based network...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 08:51;0;3;It's no different than doing it at any other point. If New User Joe doesn't do the entire history sync and generate his own UTXO state, he's left trusting everyone who claims they did. And if people *do* generate their own, there's no point to having the snapshot.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 08:02;0;0;Hardforks don't create invalid chains... and if there's two chains, it wasn't a hardfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 07:52;0;0;Checkpoints don't do that...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 07:35;0;0;No. Why would you want to?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 07:29;0;1;Immediately prior commit was adding the COPYING file. I think this might be a non-issue...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 07:24;0;4;The question makes no sense. If the block is 2 MB, then it isn't 10% full (unless the limit is 20 MB...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 07:22;0;3;The new/reduced security model creates a strong incentive to attempt such a reorg.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 07:12;0;4;Still breaks the network security. For a continuing solution, I'd prefer to see zk-SNARK proofs of the entire chain having been validated...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 07:08;0;0;I don't see how the hardfork significantly changes the situation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 07:07;0;5;Right;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 06:59;0;4;Everything that isn't a full node or a former full node. (Real SPV was never implemented.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 06:54;0;7;That would compromise the security of Bitcoin. The situation is already bad enough with pseudo-SPV nodes...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 04:55;0;0;Everyone has a right to self defense from an intentional aggressor. Again, not comparable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 04:55;0;0;The time window is very short, and in most cases preventing conception is also immoral anyway. Killing guilty people is nothing comparable to killing innocent people. The State has authority for the former.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 03:43;0;0;Murder is not an acceptable solution to anything, period. It isn't an option.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 03:42;0;7;There are already checkpoints, but that's mostly an internal implementation detail/safeguard. Even from a strict protocol perspective, it's just a softfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 02:31;0;0;Neither. Just an unavoidable tragedy we should work on improving medical capabilities to make avoidable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 00:34;0;0;No, it's at odds with the idolatry of the State that implies it has unlimited authority. The State's authority is not unlimited. It cannot legalise killing innocents.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 00:33;0;0;Conception. The first cell with its own unique and fully human DNA.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 00:21;0;0;It's no different.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 00:20;0;0;Science has made the hard line very clear. Welcome to the 21st century...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.05.2018 00:20;0;0;Yes it does. There is no such thing as lawful abortion. The law lacks authority to legalise killing innocent people.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.05.2018 23:36;0;0;At the end of the day, this whole debate is irrelevant, since murdering children is still wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.05.2018 05:32;0;0;We produce more than we consume. Stop throwing stuff away and there's no problem.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.05.2018 05:28;0;0;It's nowhere even near capacity. The entire human population today could comfortably all live in just Texas.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.05.2018 05:27;0;0;They're human people. No less important than your (or my) own life. Furthermore, while you and I have done wrong things, the fetuses are completely innocent of any evil - they deserve being murdered least of anyone. Suffering and societal problems are irrelevant to this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.05.2018 00:47;0;0;My duties come first. I would not be able to raise my children or fulfil my other duties, if I were incarcerated. If I could personally put a stop to abortion without compromising my primary duties, I would do so.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.05.2018 00:46;0;0;Mental institutions seem to manage to protect people from themselves. Besides, punishment is not merely preventative - it is also a matter of justice.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.05.2018 00:42;0;0;"This seems like a good opportunity to remind people that vigilantism is also wrong. Only States are given authority to seek retribution.

LukeDashjr;7.05.2018 23:41;0;0;https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/983613227186688000?s=19 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.05.2018 23:35;0;0;The Constitution also does not support nor defend abortion, despite the Supreme Court's abuses of power.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.05.2018 23:32;0;0;The Constitution is not God.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.05.2018 23:31;0;0;Abortion is already the highest level of escalation possible (mass murder on a massacre level).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.05.2018 23:30;0;0;I don't know what that is. I just run the open source OpenJK code.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.05.2018 23:29;0;0;Kind of, but the reality is that abortion was never actually legal (the government has no authority to legalise murder), merely left unprosecuted for a prolonged period as a matter of corrupt policy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.05.2018 23:11;0;5;Yes, speak up so we have a confession when we get to retroactive prosecution of past murders...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.05.2018 23:11;0;1;Not a good comparison. Guns are a right, whereas abortion deprives others of their rights.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.05.2018 23:08;0;0;Punishing murders with death is not tyranny. No idea how you think there can ever be a Bitcoin equivalent to murder...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.05.2018 22:49;0;0;(Just be glad we're not pushing for capital punishment yet. Because that's what this heinous crime really deserves.);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.05.2018 06:55;0;1;The tricked case isn't even aware she is allowing a murder, and the forced one is basically just unable to act. Remember that the consensual case is murder *for hire* - it's not like the mother is herself doing it. So being unable to stop or ignorant of the murder is innocent.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.05.2018 02:11;0;0;Not only is it murder. It is murder of an innocent child. And not only murder of a child, but the murderer is the very person with a duty to *protect* the child being murdered. It's basically the same as if a police officer went around shooting up schools.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.05.2018 02:05;0;0;Implying abortion isn't one of the worst possible crimes a person can commit... Good riddance.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.05.2018 05:13;0;0;Still, a crime has been committed, and the State therefore has jurisdiction. The government might *say* it's not connected, but it really is, otherwise they would have no authority to do it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.05.2018 04:33;0;1;No, there isn't, and mining pools are a distraction when all the miners are owned or operated by one entity. In Bitcoin, developers have no power. You've been fed lies.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.05.2018 04:16;0;1;BCH's miner is also a centralised entity.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.05.2018 04:00;0;0;You're insane. Reality has proven that 1 MB block size was too high, and should have been lower. LN continues to get closer to production-readiness every day.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.05.2018 03:53;0;1;Yes, you can be. BCH is a centralised, miner-run network.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.05.2018 03:46;0;0;It's part of the penalty for the current offense. The US Constitution is below God's law, and has no authority beyond what God gives to the States, and the States to the Constitution.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.04.2018 22:40;0;1;Yes, it matters. A dead chain is nothing. But it doesn't matter, because at the end of the day, money is only useful if others accept it. So the only questions are: 1) what money do you have that others will recognise?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.04.2018 21:10;0;1;Does it matter? Not really.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.04.2018 02:37;0;0;Separation of Church and State is evil heresy. Without the Church's correct moral direction, the State invents its own flawed morality. If anything, that leads to MORE suffering.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.04.2018 01:51;0;2;I will respect your decision to be confused, and not clarify the obvious.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.04.2018 01:42;0;0;The law is SUBJECT to morality. An immoral law is not a law at all, has no force, and ought to be ignored entirely.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.04.2018 00:54;0;0;Yes. The main problem is that the HDMI signal to the PC claims it is only 2 channel.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.04.2018 00:34;0;0;There's a difference between it being shoved in your face, and having to go out and look for it. Government can prevent the former at least.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.04.2018 00:29;0;0;Bottom-up is not how anything should work. Authority only ever comes from above.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.04.2018 00:26;0;2;It should be neither, really.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.04.2018 00:24;0;2;I am a practising and faithful Roman Catholic. If you wish to discuss religion, in a forum where it is an appropriate topic (or privately), I am often happy to do so. Otherwise, I don't usually bring it up.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.04.2018 00:16;0;0;Even most Catholics have not. But those who do study religion (don't even need to get into theology) with an open mind will inevitably come to accept Catholicism as truth.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.04.2018 00:11;0;0;So what happens when the market isn't given a choice? For example, there aren't any supermarkets that don't have borderline porn in the checkout aisles...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.04.2018 00:10;0;0;I didn't say the first.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.04.2018 00:09;0;0;That's basically the same kind of device as the first two I tried and found to not work as advertised. So the difficulty is getting such a device that works.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.04.2018 00:01;0;1;No, you just failed to comprehend it. Innate knowledge of God: Only that He exists. What can be learned with careful study: that He is Catholic.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.04.2018 00:00;0;0;The parents decide the best interests of their children. The medical professionals' jobs ends at advising the parents on the facts with which they can make their decision.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.04.2018 23:59;0;0;So how would, for example, a government that bans prostitution overlap with one that tolerates it?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.04.2018 23:58;0;0;Interesting point of note: we only have multiple utility provider options because the government forces them to share infrastructure...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.04.2018 23:55;0;1;Statism is belief that government should control the economy...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.04.2018 23:55;0;0;I don't think so. Even cultures can't reasonably overlap like that. But that may be a matter of practicality rather than by definition.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.04.2018 23:48;0;0;"And this does not extend only to the mere words, but to the understanding of the doctrine itself. Not only can doctrine not evolve; neither can the Church's understanding thereof.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.04.2018 23:47;0;0;No, the Church is not a democracy. It is a monarchy. Only the clergy (particularly the bishops with ordinary jurisdiction) constitute the teaching Church. Anything promulgated by every living bishop with such jurisdiction, is infallible by virtue of that fact.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.04.2018 23:46;0;1;That's a problem.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.04.2018 23:44;0;0;We don't all necessarily know anything *about* God. Careful study is necessary to come to the conclusion that the real God is Catholic.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.04.2018 23:43;0;1;The State has no authority to punish someone who has not yet committed nor is in the process of committing a crime. Even if it thinks such would prevent a crime.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.04.2018 05:57;0;2;Prove it. I have investigated several cases, and almost all of them are trolling with lies, off-topic, or such (a few were innocent mistakes that got corrected later).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.04.2018 05:28;2;52;Please learn the difference between opinions and matters of fact. Lies and fraud are not opinions, and rightfully ought to be deleted.

LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 21:45;1;4;Blockchain usually are very resource consuming. Git is on the lighter end...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 21:23;0;1;Would it be bothersome for a layman to sit in on said fencing to listen and learn, if my schedule permits?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 21:20;0;3;Why don't you consider git repos a blockchain?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 21:17;0;1;What are the author's credentials? Could he have been wrong? Especially considering Canon 188.4 (ie, even if Cum Ex were merely law, the 1917 code is yet even stronger in prohibiting a heretic from holding office).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 20:16;0;0;What is this document?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 19:50;0;0;"In that case, the sender doesn't really care what the receiver does or doesn't do with the bitcoins; and presenting it as a donation address implies the receiver is taking responsibility for ensuring reuse works out.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 19:48;0;0;(It also breaks the abstraction between addresses and output scripts.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 19:48;0;1;No, this has the problem that as soon as you broadcast a transaction, someone else can make a dummy 1 satoshi payment to the same one, and get it confirmed first to invalidate your real payment.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 10:04;0;2;If someone sends coins to a past address of yours without your permission, they are burning those coins. You have no obligation to acknowledge or recognise it as a payment. It's the same as if they send BCH or some other altcoin to your Bitcoin address.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 10:03;0;1;Again, disabling rescan breaks the normal/supported use case.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 09:54;0;1;No, that's exactly the point. There should only ever be one TXO per address. Multiple is unsupported, and while it might be okay to let it work, the default behaviour shouldn't optimise for it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 06:32;0;2;Probably. I haven't found a good solution for replacing them yet. :(;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 06:25;0;1;Yes, tipping addresses make use of this accidental behaviour. Ideally, you should make a new address for each tip.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 06:10;0;2;Why would you import an address at all? It's only supported for a single use case: watching another wallet. In that case, you need to import every single address, including old ones.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 06:10;0;2;If the coins have been spent, there is no UTXO, and we need to rescan to find the historical TXO.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 06:03;0;2;"Disabling rescanning by default can break the single-use case as well, however. Perhaps ideally, we should have a scan backward, starting with the UTXO set, and stop once the first UTXO is found"".""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 04:07;0;0;Hi @ tippr. You mean # Memocash, not # BitcoinCash. BCH isn't Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 02:20;0;1;I don't agree that unsupported misuse necessarily *must* be supported...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 02:08;0;7;Addresses don't have balances, and shouldn't have histories, just a single receive.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 02:01;0;0;A stale backup is one that is missing more recent information.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 02:00;0;7;Yes, sorry I've been hitting a few things out of order... Hopefully I can catch up soon.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 01:58;0;2;What if it was already spent?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 00:34;0;2;Fundamentally broken design: it adds a QSettings entry for pruning, which is NOT where this setting belongs, since it is inherently common to bitcoind and the GUI. Review focus should be on the prerequisitehttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11082 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.04.2018 00:10;0;0;Depends on when you made the wallet. HD wallets should never irrecoverably lose bitcoins due to stale backups. But you should still back up regularly to get your updated metadata (labels and such).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.04.2018 20:32;0;3;Obviously not, since bananas are in fact fruit. But BCH is *not* Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a category of cryptocurrencies, it is a single specific cryptocurrency.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.04.2018 20:22;0;1;It doesn't work that way. It's fraud to claim a banana is a tomato and vice-versa. Similar, it's fraud to claim BCH is Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.04.2018 20:20;0;2;All altcoins are forks of Bitcoin. But just as with other altcoins, BCH *is not* Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.04.2018 20:20;0;1;Botnets still have to compete against honest miners. And botnets *need* to use centralised pools to avoid getting caught, thereby giving their authority to someone else (the pool operator). So overall, botnets are a far less bad problem than centralised ASIC miners.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.04.2018 20:18;0;1;Hashrate doesn't matter that much...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.04.2018 09:10;0;1;It's not permissionless. PayPal is just as instant as BCH too. Most of the time, PayPal also has no fees. Lightning is a decentralised protocol. BCH is centrally controlled. Time to start questioning those lies you've been fed...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.04.2018 09:00;0;4;"No, Bitcoin is *a specific cryptocurrency*. NOT whatever you want it to be"". As a mere user, you obviously are unable to comprehend why BCH is (at least to date) no different or better than PayPal, and why Bitcoin is. But with time, that will become clearer.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.04.2018 08:56;0;2;Sure, use whatever you want. That doesn't make it Bitcoin, however.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.04.2018 08:55;0;11;"Not even joking. I've been casually observing r/btc, and they seem to have embraced Memocash"" as a legitimate name for BCH. I'm totally cool with this - we can each go in our opposite directions in peace now.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.04.2018 08:52;0;2;Yes, it is. BCH is not Bitcoin, period. Nothing will ever change this fact.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.04.2018 05:17;12;29;"Glad to see the BCH community has finally come up with a non-fraudulent name for their blockchain. I'm just confused as to whether I should call it Memo (BCH)"", ""Memocash (BCH)"", or ""http://memo.cash (BCH)""...""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.04.2018 04:26;0;1;I actually put the wrong number there, it should be 6-7 years. Historical improvements have been at a rate of about 300k per block, so 2 MB / 300k = ~6.67x;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.04.2018 01:14;0;3;Taken over? It was a problem from the start of the bcf...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.04.2018 20:33;0;1;Increasing block size further at this point might as well just be giving up on ever recovering.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.04.2018 20:33;0;1;Maybe eventually, but 1 MB blocks are 3 times faster than those improvements, and 2 MB blocks are already 6 times faster. It would take a loooooong time for improvements to catch up. For every year we run at 2 MB blocks, it will take 3 years of catch-up.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.04.2018 23:40;0;0;Uh, that it would help decentralisation is just obvious. There's very few miners today, and one of them controls over 50%. *Any* change is an improvement at this point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.04.2018 23:35;0;0;Pruned nodes are still full nodes. We only need a handful of archive nodes in datacentres.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.04.2018 23:28;0;0;What about them?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.04.2018 23:28;0;0;Nonsense. Being prepare for a PoW change reduces the risks whether or not it happens.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.04.2018 23:27;0;0;Good?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.04.2018 23:05;0;1;Yes, it's something to weigh when making the final decision.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.04.2018 23:04;0;0;I have no interest in bailing out Samsung if they're lazy or incompetent. It's trivial for manufacturers to prepare for a PoW change, and they should do so even if it weren't so desperately needed. Hopefully Samsung has enough common sense to prepare for it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.04.2018 20:42;0;1;No, it doesn't.

LukeDashjr;23.04.2018 02:33;0;0;And don't forget, you'd need to bribe/threaten *everyone* in the group.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.04.2018 02:33;0;0;Well, obviously we wouldn't have everyone be from the same jurisdiction...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.04.2018 02:31;0;0;No, the group would ONLY be given the power (via hardfork, necessarily requiring consensus) to decide the new PoW algorithm. Nothing else.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.04.2018 01:48;0;0;Something like 50-200 people, whatever is necessary to get at least one member of the group trusted by everyone.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.04.2018 00:04;0;0;SHA2 is already their best chance at that. Anything else reduces their ability to do so.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.04.2018 00:04;0;0;4) Get consensus on BIP. 5) Full nodes release with hardfork logic. 6) Everyone upgrades. 7) Multi-sig group signs hardfork activation with final PoW algorithm decision, and activation occurs immediately. 8) Unused code can be removed from full node implementations.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.04.2018 00:02;0;0;1) Get consensus on PoW change concept. 2a) Developers implement and test many candidate algorithms. 2b, concurrently) Get consensus on a multi-sig group to decide new PoW algorithm from candidates at the last minute. 3) Write BIP with details from 2a and 2b. (continued...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.04.2018 00:00;0;0;Back to FUD again. None of that is true with consensus.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.04.2018 21:58;0;1;New facilities don't need to be built to manufacture miners. And while there's an argument to say the fat man may have some advantage, that advantage is still much reduced from where it is *now*.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.04.2018 21:54;0;1;"An argument can be made for that, but for purposes of this poll, please treat centralised mining pools as mining whatever the pool is mining. ;)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.04.2018 21:54;0;1;The analogy was to demonstrate why it *feels* crowded, but really isn't. Nothing more. The whole point of a new algorithm, is that it will give everyone an equal opportunity.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.04.2018 21:50;0;1;Wish I could have had an option for that. Sadly, Twitter only allows 4 poll options.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.04.2018 21:43;0;0;(Although it's a lot easier to achieve consensus once the precedent has been set.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.04.2018 21:43;0;0;So just avoid anyone knowing in advance. That's why we're not recommending any specific algorithm until *after* we have consensus for a change. If we later fail to achieve consensus, it's no worse off than if we don't achieve it the first time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.04.2018 21:40;3;6;Do you mine blocks on the # Bitcoin network? (Mining altcoins and being paid in bitcoins such as with Nicehash doesn't count!);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.04.2018 21:34;0;0;No. The better solution is to make the fat guy stop hoarding the food to himself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.04.2018 21:27;0;1;It's not. It only *seems* crowded because there's a fat guy sitting at the buffet pushing everyone else out so they can't eat.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.04.2018 21:25;0;0;SHA2 is not fair anymore. Weaknesses were found. Now that it is broken, the only thing we can do is try another one that has a good shot at working. Worst case, it is also found to be weak, and we move on to the next one.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.04.2018 20:30;0;1;SHA2 was supposed to be it, but time proved it vulnerable to AsicBoost and such. There are plenty of other viable candidates, but only time will tell if they survive the bounty of Bitcoin being offered to break them. No excuse not to try.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.04.2018 19:19;0;0;Not an advantage, no. It'd be just as easy for them as for anyone else. (*Maybe* slightly easier for them, but the advantage is much less than it is with SHA2.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.04.2018 19:16;0;0;implying there are other real cryptocurrencies...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.04.2018 18:00;0;0;No, that argument implies Bitmain should be stopped from doing so. But for PoW the goal is for *anyone* to be able to do it on a mostly-level equal field. Bitmain included.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.04.2018 16:14;0;0;Rather, when the claim is itself unfounded and merely creates fear for no reason.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.04.2018 02:53;0;0;"Only if you count each single big corporation as millions of people"" (which they of course aren't in reality).""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 21:18;0;0;There *aren't* many people. The shovel makers are refusing to sell the shovels and hoarding them for themselves.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 20:09;0;1;There's no comparison...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 19:42;0;0;Indeed. That's kinda the point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 19:42;0;0;No, that's why you choose a new PoW that is intentionally easy for anyone to make.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 19:41;0;1;Let's pretend they're wildly profitable, and BigCo decides it's worth their time to make miners. Why would BigCo sell those miners to the public fairly, rather than just self-mine using them like Bitfury and Bitmain are doing?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 19:38;0;3;Wishful thinking.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 19:37;0;0;It is an outlier. Pretending it isn't is just wilful ignorance.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 19:32;0;3;Once it gets past a certain point (which we passed years ago), it is binary. And competition has only reduced with time. Halong is an outlier, and most likely won't bring any long-term improvement (happy to be proven wrong).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 19:31;0;2;In theory, yes. But in this case, the mining pools are being used to mask that Bitmain actually controls over 50% of the hardware too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 02:44;0;1;Sure, but that's beside the point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 02:40;0;1;Why only singles then?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 02:32;0;1;Ownership is the legal side. Possession is the control side.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 02:04;0;2;You own bitcoins, just not possess them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 01:19;0;2;Owning bitcoins is not owning keys.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 01:05;0;0;Last time it came up, Vitalik confirmed it, so...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 01:03;0;2;But this is beside the point: the reality is still that there are nearly 150k Bitcoin full nodes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 01:02;0;0;(And of course, nobody has managed to get an entire consensus system of any sort to run as a zk-SNARK);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 01:02;0;0;Let's say you got Ethereum or Bitcoin to run in a zk-SNARK. Someone makes a proof they validated the entire chain. What stops someone else from copying that proof over and over? You can't prove *a particular person* or *how many people* did the verification...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 00:56;0;1;Nothing can be verified, period. That doesn't mean the numbers aren't truth.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 00:51;0;0;The rules are implemented as code. I don't know of any comprehensive list.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 00:50;0;0;No, there is no way to verify the enforcement, only the claims. But those presented claim to be full nodes (or at least very close to it).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 00:35;0;2;Full nodes are ones which validate and enforce every single rule on the blockchain. Last I heard, this was pretty much impractical with Ethereum, and almost nobody does it. Instead, people tend to pretend some inferior security level is equivalent, when it really isn't.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 00:25;1;1;"The services"" field is an Object, with a mapping from individual service bits (by bit number IIRC) to ratio of nodes (with that UA) supporting it. So if the UA has 100 nodes, and bit ""1"" has 0.5, there are 100*0.5 nodes of that UA with that service bit.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 00:23;0;0;AIUI, there's very few (maybe single-digits?) Ethereum nodes that meet Bitcoin's definition of a full node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 00:23;0;1;I might be willing to consider sharing the algorithm with someone reputable making an accurate Ethereum chart... but I'm concerned that it might give a false equivalence between Ethereum's not-really-full nodes and Bitcoin's full nodes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 00:19;0;10;Scamcoins use # Bitcoin's technology without its currency. Bitbills, Casascius coins, off-chain @ Coinbase transfers, and so on use currency of bitcoins without Bitcoin technology. Owning bitcoins does not in any sense imply ownership of any of the technology.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.04.2018 00:17;0;0;The algorithm is game-able if someone knew what it was. So the code is only available for review by reputable developers who I can trust won't screw with it. Not sure what you're asking with the second part.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 22:36;0;2;All false...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 21:08;0;1;???;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 20:53;0;3;Why this Friday specifically? O.o;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 19:43;0;0;None. The graphs are not open source.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 19:30;0;0;"The roots are Jesus, Catholic doctrine, and St. Peter, in that order. States never enter into the picture. I don't know better"" - I merely follow what the Church teaches.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 19:29;0;0;Whether there will be another pope or not is up to God, and not a problem if He decides there won't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 19:29;0;0;No, he isn't. And that question is only circular because a non-Catholic cannot be pope. Canon Law can never make someone a pope who Divine Law (ie, doctrine) says cannot. I don't reject Canon Law, I merely apply it as it was intended to be applied.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 18:59;0;0;Rome and Jerusalem are not Catholicism. They are not apostolic churches, they are States. No special revelation is needed to adhere to the Catholic Faith. Simply following the teachings of the Apostles and the Catholic Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 18:44;0;14;Related to anything, really...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 18:43;0;0;In order to be pope, under *Catholic doctrine* (which FYI *trumps* Canon Law), you must be a Catholic. Under *both* Catholic doctrine *and* Canon Law, an impossible law does not bind. So if there are no cardinals, cardinals are not required to elect.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 18:41;0;0;Yet again you express complete ignorance in Catholicism...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 10:44;0;0;Heretics have no unity.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 10:44;0;0;Francis is none of that. He is a heretic like Martin Luther or Mohammad. I'm not aware of any Catholic Churches in Jerusalem. In Rome, there is the Oratory of St. Gregory VII.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 10:32;0;0;"(Catholics never join other religions; you'd all need to rejoin the Church)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 10:29;0;0;He would then need to be accepted by the Church as pope, and be validly consecrated a bishop. Only then could he become pope. But perhaps this last step would not be necessary to heal your schism from the Church? After all, you are the ones in schism, so it's up to you...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 10:26;0;0;Francis (or his successor) converts to Catholicism, making a public abjuration of heresy, condemning Vatican II, admitting that John XXIII through himself were not true popes, and seeking reconciliation with the Church (being received by one of the Catholic bisohps).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 10:24;0;0;"I would sooner abandon Christianity altogether. The Modernist sect has zero potential of being the true religion, since it contradicts Catholicism. Unless this hypothetical circumstance count"": ... 1/2""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 10:12;0;0;I don't recall the ratio at the time of the council itself, but at one point the bishops faithful to Catholicism were reduced to only two (the pope and St. Athanasius). All the rest were Arians.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 10:03;0;0;Because God prevails in the end.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 10:03;0;0;And even if you insist on denying the historical fact that Arians had 99%... It is still completely compatible with the Catholic religion that 99% can apostate. What *isn't* compatible, is the claim that a heretic can be a pope - that is itself heresy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 09:51;0;0;Sounds like you need to learn history...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 09:37;0;0;We haven't started any sect, merely continued on as Catholics always have. And yes, the Church has been reduced to 1% of its size before. See the Arian heresy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.04.2018 09:31;0;0;It is Catholic doctrine that non-Catholics cannot under any circumstances hold office. Affirming Catholic doctrine simply makes me a Catholic, not something else. https://dashjr.org/catholic/sedevacantist.php …;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 20:47;0;0;Overt AB as used by Halong's miners violates the current protocol rules.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 20:46;0;0;You don't have one.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 20:46;0;0;No, mining is absolutely not decentralised anymore.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 20:45;0;0;"No, it actually isn't. And it's not sedevacantism"", it's Roman Catholicism.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:41;0;0;There are varying degrees that people make use of their capacity to reason. People who are entirely unreasonable, end up in mental institutions.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:39;0;0;You can't have an argument or even a discussion at all, unless you first assume the validity of reason.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:38;0;0;I think you'd notice pretty fast if you had nobody to do business with.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:38;0;0;Bad popes are one thing. Not-a-pope-at-all is another. I am not starting a small group, or any group at all - I merely remain united to the Roman Catholic Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:37;0;1;"Decentralisation of mining isn't merely desirable; it is a critical basis for Bitcoin's security model.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:36;0;0;The validity of reason itself is self-evident to any human being.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:36;0;0;Well, they're clearly calling our bluff right now - and we're showing them that we're not willing to do it!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:36;0;0;P.S. The Oratory of St. Gregory VII is a legitimate Catholic chapel in Rome that rejects antipope Francis.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:34;0;0;"Political Rome is not the Catholic Church. It doesn't matter who runs the State there. According to them"" is also irrelevant. Verifiable facts are all that matter. They cannot show any doctrine we deny, and as such, they are clearly liars about us being heretics.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:33;0;0;On the other hand, it is trivial to show any of the many doctrines that antipope Francis denies. We can pick one of them, show that the Church has officially taught it, and show that Francis publicly denies it. It is clear as day that Francis is not Catholic.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:32;0;0;Any such claims can be proven either true or false. Ask them: what doctrine did Pope St. Anacletus deny? When did the Church formally define that doctrine? Since Pp. St. Anacletus did not in fact deny any doctrine, they will be unable to show it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:30;0;0;No, just as long as we are willing to change it when necessary, miners will realise it's stupid to centralise, and we won't *need* to change it anymore.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:30;0;0;Sure you can. As long as you have a general idea how many Bitcoin users there are, and know how much hashrate you personally have, you can get a reasonable approximation of how much is decentralised.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:27;0;0;Feelings have nothing to do with reasoning. What you're worshipping is something more like hedonism. Reasoning is HOW we know which claims are valid.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:24;0;0;"I am already a Roman Catholic. It is you who is not. Some ancient heretic is not comparable; he cannot claim it without lying. I, however, state it in truth.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:20;0;0;You clearly *didn't* become a Catholic. What you're describing is not Catholicism.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:18;0;0;Segwit was a protocol change. No miners, not even 100%, can control that. But that doesn't mean control over mining isn't a problem.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:18;0;0;So it's okay with you to have a trusted entity running Bitcoin, so long as you don't witness them doing certain things? Why not just use the USD?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:17;0;0;Unity is assent to Catholic dogma. Nothing less. If you reject even a single Catholic doctrine, YOU are the one leaving the Unity of the Faith by your own free will. The Unity continues to remain within the Church - you've merely left it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:16;0;0;Religious dogma is what Catholicism is. Particularly the religious dogma that God Himself revealed to the Apostles. That's how the Catholic Church works. Feelings do not matter at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:15;0;0;Even simply having control of such a dangerously large part of the network is already crossing the line.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:07;0;0;The community has proven it is not. I do not agree there is any rationale to claim it is not needed. We are so far beyond needing it, that would be a bad joke.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:06;0;0;(And these things are not merely my opinions: they are Catholic doctrine. If you reject them, I am sad to say, that would mean you are not a Catholic yourself.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:05;1;0;The Holy Ghost is not present in the religious services of false religions, and it is a mortal sin to participate in them or even be present for them without serious reason. If there is any spiritual presence, it is that of demons. Furthermore, normal people cannot feel spirits.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:03;0;0;They crossed those lines a long time ago.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:03;0;0;There are many alternative PoW algorithms. The only way to prevent it from happening again, is to get the incentives right. We do that by proving the community is willing to act by changing PoW when needed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 13:00;0;0;Jesus apparently has allowed that we will not have a pope for the moment. Perhaps as punishment for our lukewarmness, allowing the Modernists to flourish, and many other faults. Only God knows when He will restore the Church to her prior prominence in society.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:57;0;0;I recommend reading this Q&A by Bishop Sanborn: http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/SSPX_QA_RevPDF2.pdf …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:56;0;0;Ends Bitmain's monopoly, immediately restores decentralised mining using GPUs, makes it easy for new manufacturers to enter the market, and sets precedents that fix the problem of manufacturers & miners being incentivised to centralise the PoW.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:55;0;0;Why are you claiming I wasn't? This goes back to before S9s were even a thing...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:54;0;0;I'm pretty selective about Facebook friends...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:53;0;0;You cannot both be a Catholic and say Francis is pope. That is impossible, because the Catholic religion teaches that heretics like Francis can never be pope under any circumstances.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:53;0;1;This is nothing but FUD. A PoW change would ENABLE people to mine it like they used to.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:52;0;0;The Church has very specific criteria for what it means to be a Catholic, who can hold office in the Church, and who can become pope. Francis's sect does not meet those criteria.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:51;0;0;His sect is a sect because it isn't the Catholic Church. We started with 12 bishops and a room full of followers. It's absurd to claim the Church can't be reduced to many times that size. If anyone is BCH, it is Francis's sect.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:50;0;0;Protocol changes are not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:50;0;0;If anything, a fresh algorithm *encourages* new players to enter the market.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:50;0;0;If Halong/Samsung (same effort) are at all competent, their chips are already able to support an alternative PoW in preparation for such a PoW change. That's been recommended to manufacturers since 2012 - and that was before there was even a problem!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:48;0;0;Not necessarily, no. It would set a clear precedent that if someone re-centralised the new algorithm, obviously it would just be changed again. So nobody will try to.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:48;0;0;Nobody is suggesting doing it without consensus.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:47;0;0;That doesn't solve it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:47;0;0;Claims don't matter. Truth does. You won't find those marks in Francis's sect. But by definition, the Catholic Church must have them. Francis is the one who disagrees with previous/real popes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:46;0;0;Why do you say it is? Halong's miners USE AsicBoost.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:45;0;0;Not likely. Halong's miners USE AsicBoost - and without even seeking consent of the network first. That's not solving at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:43;0;1;We have ZERO security (in this respect) right now. PoS isn't a solution, but any other PoW algorithm would work.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:42;1;1;"And Bitcoin's security model isn't bribe the Fed-equivalent so that it's not in their interests to attack"". If you want that, the USD is already doing it.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:41;0;0;I'm not suggesting PoS. I'm suggesting we simply switch to a *non-broken* PoW algorithm.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:41;0;0;It's not solved. Not even close.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:41;0;0;"The only one Francis's sect has any claim to is Universality. They DON'T have unity of faith; and they DON'T call anyone to holiness (a-ok to live in adultery now, according to them); and they use a ritual for consecrating bishops"" that Pope Leo XIII formally declared invalid.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:39;0;0;The Church isn't so huge these days, but size isn't what defines it. The Church is identified by four marks: Unity of Faith (as you mentioned), Holiness, Universality, and Apostolicity.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:24;0;0;Who's starting a new church? We're just remaining within the RCC. Francis's sect isn't the RCC. If it were, then Hell would have prevailed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:21;0;2;Pretty sure NIST corrected their document too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 12:06;0;1;I don't care too much if BCH is centralised.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 09:47;0;2;It would help BCH, but that's okay. Bitcoin has real merits to compete on. It can only reduce Bitmain's position. Right now, they are effectively 100%.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 09:29;0;1;The longer we wait, the weaker Bitcoin gets, and the stronger Bitmain gets. Why wait? There's no benefit to waiting.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 09:19;0;0;We've been doing that for years now. It just gets worse and worse.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 07:44;0;0;Yes, I don't think PoS is a viable option. (It's been a while since I read it, but that was the primary thing I had a problem with in it.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 07:42;0;2;Point is that your theory isn't sound.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 07:41;0;0;Closest thing i know to this ishttps://medium.com/@CobraBitcoin/an-open-letter-to-the-bitcoin-community-to-change-the-proof-of-work-algorithm-12a6545c20d0 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 07:30;0;1;Yet all the competition died, proving your overall theory wrong, regardless of the steps you took to get there.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 07:27;0;0;"At this point, there aren't really any cons. Just FUD. The most important pro is that it fixes what is currently critically broken in Bitcoin: the centralised PoW"" algorithm that is assigned more than work at this point.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 07:24;0;1;But if 2+2 always came out to be 3 in practice, then you'd know there was something wrong with or missing in your understanding of mathematics. Example: perhaps that's $2k + $2k profits, and your bank account ends with only $3k - there's probably some unconsidered overhead.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 06:51;0;3;Just ignoring the reality, I see... Maybe you should learn the history of Bitcoin. We HAD competition. That was LOST with higher profitability and investments. So clearly your theory does NOT hold up in practice.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 06:46;0;1;And no, irrationally and disingenuously opposing a necessary PoW change for Bitcoin makes him one of the bad guys if anything.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 06:43;0;2;You are ignoring Bitcoin's history. We HAD competition. Lots of it. And the correlation to price is the other direction: capital investments follow as price increases.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 06:03;0;1;You again don't know what you're talking about. But I already [tried to] explain it to you, so I'm getting the sense you're just trolling disingenuously now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.04.2018 05:41;0;2;"Again, you call it unexpected"" when it is completely expected. Again, you assume DragonMint was so incompetent as to leave their customers without a backup PoW.

LukeDashjr;16.04.2018 07:25;0;2;(And why we need to show that we're willing to do so, if we want to have any expectation of decentralisation in the future.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.04.2018 07:14;0;1;It's how they can avoid a PoW change to brick them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.04.2018 06:52;0;1;I would if I could find a buyer (*at $25k/BTC)... but that's not income regardless.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.04.2018 06:43;0;1;(And obviously no bulk discounts, or cloud mining nonsense. Unless they implemented working SP-ASICs, which make cloud mining decentralisation-safe.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.04.2018 06:42;0;0;If they couldn't keep up with the demand at such reasonable prices, they would ration sales so that no one entity can deprive smaller entities of their miners.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.04.2018 06:41;0;0;An *ideal* company would only produce and sell ASICs at a reasonable profit (not simply at the highest possible profit), never mine themselves (outside of perhaps some brief burn-in testing, which is used to subsidize the cost).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.04.2018 06:15;0;0;Because Bitfury is just Bitmain at a smaller scale. They're part of the problem. Decentralisation would be against their interests, too. Timeline would have to depend on the nature of the final consensus.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.04.2018 05:58;0;0;A PoW change will help by restoring decentralisation overnight to GPU miners, and giving the ASIC ecosystem a second chance to re-bootstrap fairly. Bitmain started with more competition than they have today, and any competitors can trivially prepare for a PoW change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.04.2018 05:16;0;0;Anyone starting a mining operation without being prepared for a PoW change, in the current environment, is taking a huge risk. That's *their* risk, not something we should feel obliged to bail them out on.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.04.2018 18:38;0;0;No, it wouldn't. The seat has been empty hundreds of times, and it was never a problem.

LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 18:21;0;13;When considering ideas like this, do keep in mind that commercial copyright infringement becomes a criminal matter (as opposed to non-commercial which is just civil).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 18:18;0;0;Slavery isn't evil, just not an ideal human condition. We should seek to abolish it, but there is no sin to become a slave or slave master (so long as it's fairly entered into, and not forbidden by law).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 17:59;0;0;That's a contradiction.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 17:50;0;1;The Vatican has been home to a false religion for the past 50 years, after the Catholic Church lost control of it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 16:59;0;1;There's an overview of some of them here: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608b.htm#IB … Search engines can find you more.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 16:56;1;1;Catholicism is God-made, and absolutely true in every respect.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 16:56;0;0;Simply repeatedly making delusional assertions that are obviously wrong, seems much more like trolling than discussing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 16:55;0;0;I don't know the reasons God has for the things God allows. I'm just a mere human. That's not my business to know.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 16:54;0;0;You're just exposing the depth of your delusions now. Next step is to be blocked for trolling.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 16:52;0;0;If everyone owns guns, everyone can defend themselves. Violent crimes often do significantly reduce or stop. Most violent crime in the USA is in areas where guns are banned. At least one city requires adults to have firearms, and their murder rate has been *zero* for decades now;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 16:51;0;1;Depends on the proof, I guess. Quite a few are necessarily a single god.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 16:44;0;0;No, it isn't. Crime still happens in both Europe and the USA. Police obviously do not prevent it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 16:36;0;0;It is completely impractical to have police provide safety. You would need a huge chunk of the population doing nothing but preventing crimes, and no crimes would exist to prevent with such widespread surveillance, so they would just be idly mooching off society unsustainably.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 16:35;0;1;"Zero idols; and there's nothing superstitious about the Saints.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 16:30;0;0;Perhaps single adults can justify being unconcerned with their own safety, but us parents have a grave duty to defend our family, and must concern ourselves with safety. (Government/police do not exist to provide safety, /just/ justice.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 16:25;0;0;The absence of superstition is to be found in Catholicism, since it consists only of truth, and condemns strongly any superstition.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 16:25;0;1;Atheism is the belief that there is no God. Since God's existence is a proven fact, this denial of Him is unjustified. Similarly, the belief that nature can exist without a cause is also unjustified - and that's where it's pretty obviously superstitious.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 16:23;0;0;Imprisonment should also be about justice, not just rehabilitation. And who said anything about imprisonment? Mass murderers should be executed. Banning guns may make it harder for criminals to get them, but it makes it impossible for law-abiding citizens to do so.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 16:20;0;0;Murder *should* be dangerous to attempt. It's only fair that if you try to kill someone, your own life is at risk too. (And no, statistics don't suggest that.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 16:20;0;0;So you think we shouldn't prosecute criminals at all? Quality of life is only likely to prevent crime if you threaten to take away that quality of life when crime is committed...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 16:18;0;1;No more than I worry about the quality of life of anyone else outside my family. But if you mean basic necessities like food, health care, etc, I support the government stepping in if (and only if) society is too greedy to provide through charity. But I'm not a republican either;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 16:10;0;0;Not only is belief in God more than justified, that definition fits *atheism* quite well... So one could correctly say atheism is itself superstition.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 15:49;0;0;(I'm much less confident in my understanding of #2, so I will refer you to Bishop Sanborn's sermon given yesterday, which is the first time I was exposed to that concept: http://mhtseminary.libsyn.com/sermon-holy-providence-part-1-by-bp-donald-sanborn … );;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 15:47;0;0;2) We can will only what God allows us to will, but God's providence extends not only to our will in this respect, but also to the means by which we will it. That is, He determines not only that we will X, but also that we will X by our free will.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 15:46;0;0;I know two possible answers. One or both of them may be correct. 1) Free will extends only to our will, not to our actions. To act on our will requires God to allow it. (God only allows it, when He can bring about good from it in some way.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 09:24;0;0;"Not an event; just researching religion, I came to accept that Catholicism is in fact objectively true.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 09:23;0;1;Not significantly, if it's just another SHA2 variant.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 08:00;0;0;Just because God allows us to do something, does not mean He has given us authority to do it, or that we are justified in doing it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:48;0;0;Stating a fact, nothing more.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:46;0;0;I'm not, God is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:43;0;0;Good to know. Such things ideally should be quite rare.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:42;0;0;"Unjustly"" was ""unlawfully"", except without the unclarity that results from invalid ""laws"" purporting to legalise murder (which the State does NOT have the authority to do). Human being is pretty well-defined by science. DNA and all that.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:41;0;0;God grants the State the right to create such an obligation for us.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:36;0;0;No, by obligation. We are obliged to pay our taxes. We should not require coercion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:35;0;0;Indeed, and a rebellion can only be justified when the revolters can claim to be acting as a State.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:35;0;0;Intentionally and unjustly taking the life of another human being.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:33;0;0;The State is funding those things, not you.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:32;0;0;Here's an explanation of the principles involved: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm … Using those principles, you can look at the world situation, and figure out which, if any, may or should be rebelled against.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:30;0;0;If they have murdered someone, they are. If they haven't, they aren't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:30;0;0;Are you confusing Vatican City (the State) with the Catholic Church (the religious organization)? They're two different things, even if for a time they had overlap of leadership.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:26;0;0;The State could do that, and sometimes it does. But it's not necessarily better or worse to do it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:26;0;0;If they are murderers, that is true regardless of what I call them. Pretending they're not murderers will never change that fact.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:24;0;0;Note that Vatican City, as a Catholic nation, is strictly historical. I'm not aware of it having had any real economy to exercise control over. But I could be wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:21;0;0;I don't know and I don't care, because it doesn't matter.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:20;0;0;Why would you claim Vatican City was a Statist State?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:20;0;0;They can choose what they personally fund. But taxes are not our own money - it belongs to the State.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:18;0;0;Just because a State abuses power and acts outside its authority does not in itself justify rebellion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:17;0;0;I don't know the statistics. A quick search suggested 28% of women in a particular age range, which isn't anywhere near all women. One also needs to consider the possibility of ignorance, which could reduce the crime to manslaughter. In any case, it's irrelevant.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:16;0;0;Liar.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:13;0;0;I'm getting tired of your trolling.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:13;0;0;What? It's not for a mere human like me to know God's purposes for sure. Only to act according to the duties He has given me.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:12;0;0;The number of people who commit murder will never change the fact that murder is the unjustified killing of another person. I'm not using it incorrectly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:11;0;0;I never said anything even remotely suggesting the State's authority is unlimited.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:11;0;0;I don't support Statism.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:07;0;0;I hear things are pretty absurd in Venezuela, but I don't follow it closely enough to know for sure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:07;0;0;"It's not better because it's a choice. It's better because it isn't funding mass murder. That is, no choice: cannot fund mass murder"" is better than ""choose not to fund mass murder"" is less bad than ""no choice: must fund mass murder"". Choice is not the good. Just a means to it""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 07:00;0;0;It would be less bad. What would be good, is the State prosecuting anyone who funds mass murder.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:55;0;0;The Holy Inquisition and Crusades were a good thing, not destructive.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:54;0;0;I don't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:53;0;0;I have a bias toward the truth, yes... (Keep in mind I wasn't raised Catholic. I converted.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:52;0;0;Taxes belong to the State. What they do with them is not my responsibility. But as I said, obviously it would be better if nobody funded (nor tolerated) mass murder.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:50;0;0;Human sacrifice was a facet of a false religion. Atheism is just another false religion. Human sacrificers have more in common with you, than with me.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:49;0;1;No, everything is God's grace. Islam and Buddhism are not defensible. They can be shown to be false.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:48;0;0;You are delusional.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:48;0;0;I don't fund it. The State does. It would be better if the State did not, but the State's obligation is to prosecute murderers, so merely not funding it would never be sufficient alone.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:46;0;1;I don't consider myself well-informed enough to comment on that particular matter.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:45;0;0;Yet denial of God is the most ignorant thing a person could do.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:44;0;1;Lots. The most obvious one is tolerating the mass murder of unborn children.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:41;0;1;We can certainly oppose the evil actions of States. But we must not oppose their legitimate exercise of the authority God has granted them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:39;0;0;Knowledge that the person they love both deserves and prefers Hell. As well as a greater love of God than of any of His creatures.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:38;0;2;Correct, God gives me the duty to defend my family, so at least by default, God wills me to act in defense of them, even if that means I must kill the attacker. In the end, God will also will the outcome of the attack, and whether my defence is successful or not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:37;0;0;http://www.catholictradition.org/Classics/heliotropium.htm …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:36;0;2;Just because God [permissively] willed that someone be starving, or commit murder, does *not* mean that He does not *also* will that we feed the starving person, or jail the murderer. Indeed, many times God allows starvation for the express purpose of someone to feed the person.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:34;0;0;You seem to be working under the assumption that suffering is bad.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:33;0;4;Many States are not Statism in any form. (Statism is State control over the economy, not the concept of the State in general.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:33;0;0;Just because a State has legitimate authority does not make them suddenly right in all they do. It just means they act with State authority, and we are obligated to obey their just laws.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:32;0;0;With the other greater knowledge that also comes with being in Heaven. (There's a word for refusing to believe the truth simply because you don't like it...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:31;0;0;Who do you think you are, to stand in judgement over the Creator and Judge of all?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:30;0;0;"Well, at least that's a reasonable argument to be making. But if you study the matter enough, you will find that I don't have a God"", I merely follow the true God.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:30;0;2;Yes, even the worst States had legitimate authority from God. That doesn't justify their abuse of power, only obligates us to obey their legitimate laws. Nothing happens without God allowing it, so yes, when the control of States changes, it is because God willed it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:28;0;0;Depends on the nature of the separation. If it is mere rebellion, they have no authority (and are in the wrong) until the war is over - unless, their rebellion is justified by the State itself (that is, by its constitution).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:26;0;0;God is existence. Nature, on the other hand, is not enough unto itself - it is inherently part of causality, and everything natural requires a cause.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:23;0;0;Obviously nobody. God is the uncaused cause.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:23;0;0;Anarchy is disorder. States are part of order.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:22;0;0;The one that de facto functions as a State in your locale.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:19;0;0;There's only one real God. But addressing your denial thereof is not within the scope of this conversation. If you had any interest in the truth, you wouldn't be denying Him in the first place, so I'm not going to waste my time on it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:17;0;4;God isn't superstition, and the irrational thing is to deny He exists.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:04;0;1;God does.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 06:04;0;0;Such individualism is a *disorder*, not the proper order of society.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 05:28;0;8;Policing requires the authority of the State. Otherwise, the police force has no right to act against criminals - it'd just be vigilantism.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 05:19;0;0;Anarchism is not morally acceptable. Rule of law is necessary for a properly ordered society.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 05:12;0;1;The USA's founding principles were always very sub-par. Monarchy as in the middle ages would be a much better government.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 04:30;0;0;No, just plain old monarchism is pretty close to ideal.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 04:30;0;2;New manufacturers should be designing their chips with a backup/alternate algorithm or two.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.04.2018 04:23;0;23;Anarchism and statism are two extremes. Both are problematic. The real solution to both, is in between.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.04.2018 20:58;0;0;(Additionally, banning abortion is proven to reduce most cases.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.04.2018 20:57;0;0;"The two are not comparable. Guns are not evil, and can be used for good. They stop not only gun violence"", but violence in general. One does not need a gun for violence. Abortions are always inherently evil, and even if we couldn't stop any by banning it, we still should ban.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.04.2018 14:29;0;2;Last updated? That page is realtime...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.04.2018 01:58;0;0;What you're doing (misrepresenting me) is called the straw-man fallacy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.04.2018 21:00;0;0;Considering the situation, anyone investing in mining for the last several years should expect a PoW change. So definitely not unexpected.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.04.2018 20:07;0;0;That's true with or without PoW change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.04.2018 19:46;0;0;Yes, it's all fake news. Vangheluwe is and always was a fraud. He was probably validly ordained, but by a non-Catholic bishop, as part of a non-Catholic religion. His consecration as bishop was also completely invalid. He has never had any role in the Roman Catholic Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.04.2018 17:40;0;0;Hitachi, okay, but why would you want a bunch of oppressive companies (Apple, Nvidia, Google, Tesla) involved?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.04.2018 16:41;0;3;AFAIK Monero *doesn't* use CT. It might even predate CT. It uses ring signatures. Disclaimer: There might or might not be common cryptography to both of these concepts.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.04.2018 00:35;0;2;Don't have to be sure. Anything is better than where we are now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.04.2018 00:02;0;0;No, it's the barrier of entry. Bitmain has their SHA2 dominance solidified, and until recently locked anyone else out of competition.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.04.2018 23:43;7;62;Fear of a PoW change making current miners obsolete is pure FUD. Miner obsoletion happens with or without PoW changes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.04.2018 23:43;11;45;PSA: SHA2 miners would indeed be obsoleted by a PoW change, but that's *normal* for miners: every generation has been made obsolete and unprofitable by every generation of SHA2 miners after that. Halong's AsicBoost miners made Bitmain's (publicly-available) SHA2 miners obsolete.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.04.2018 19:30;0;1;You got the BCH for free. That's 0 basis, by definition. Whether you like it or not, it's fair.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.04.2018 19:15;0;0;0 basis is a bad thing, not a good thing...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.04.2018 19:15;0;0;No, BCH is just an altcoin that gives a premine to Bitcoin holders as of its launch date.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.04.2018 19:14;0;0;No, @ mflaxman was trying to insist that because of technical similarities, altcoins and hardforks must be treated the same. I'm saying that's *not* the case.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.04.2018 18:26;0;0;Hardforks and altcoins are two very different things.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.04.2018 16:16;0;1;Perhaps there could be, but it seems to me that it's a gift either way...?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.04.2018 10:41;2;5;Conclusions are only as valid as the premises are true. BCH is no different from any other premined altcoin. It is not a split, spinoff, or anything comparable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.04.2018 19:21;0;0;We can when absolute Truth Himself tells us. But more importantly, our inability to know perfectly what absolute truth is, does not change the fact that absolute truth exists.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.04.2018 04:32;0;0;Logic is logic. Claiming two contradicting statements can be true, is nothing less than renouncing logic. Since it is renouncing logic, it is a waste of time to consider or discuss.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.04.2018 03:34;0;0;1) Catholic priests are not molesting children. 2) Even if we include the many frauds who lie about being Catholic priests, the rate of molestation is lower than any other institution. 3) Catholics have never claimed God chooses all priests.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;1.04.2018 04:54;0;0;That's a black-and-white question. Nodes may accept the blocks, but will issue warnings to the user because they believe they have been degraded to less than full node security.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.03.2018 14:15;0;0;We know Bitcoin *does not* work with centralised mining. We also know Bitcoin works perfectly fine with decentralised mining, as it had from 2009-2012.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.03.2018 06:36;0;11;Describing *how* one can possibly do a hardfork in a centralised currency, is not in any sense suggesting or requesting it actually be done.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.03.2018 06:29;2;26;You're an idiot. Satoshi never requested to increase the block size. BCH is not Bitcoin. Lightning was (albeit lacking in design) part of the original plan. Bitcoin today is much closer to p2p electronic cash than BCH probably ever will be.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.03.2018 06:27;0;1;Killing is any taking of life (including, FWIW, that of plants and animals). Murder is only the deliberate taking of human life without God's consent. God has only expressed to us that His consent is ordinarily available for defense and capital punishment.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.03.2018 05:29;0;0;Sounds like a mistranslation of the Commandment against murder. Not all killing is murder.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.03.2018 04:51;0;0;Bitcoin is a specific cryptocurrency. It's not about ownership. And no, BCH is not closer to Bitcoin than Bitcoin is.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.03.2018 04:06;0;0;The USA is full of anti-gun regions, which is where most of the homicides occur.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.03.2018 04:06;0;4;Why do you think it's relevant? If you're killed with a gun, are you going to spend eternity wishing it had been with a knife instead???;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.03.2018 03:21;0;1;If the government oversteps too far, then yes, civil war is better than complete oppression. In the meantime, the risk of civil war acts as a powerful deterrent to such overstepping.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.03.2018 03:18;1;9;That the only statistics that matter are: crime, violent crime, and murders. Whether a gun is used or not in the crime is entirely irrelevant.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.03.2018 03:16;0;0;It hasn't always worked out that way, certainly not in America. And the threat isn't necessarily just from our own government either: no foreign power would dare invade us as we are now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.03.2018 03:15;0;4;No, the issue is that you are working from a false premise.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.03.2018 03:06;0;0;Even with the population well-armed, government has not been kept in check. The US sees regular abuses of power by government officials, and countries outside the US are at least as bad (typically worse). Citizen disarmament clearly makes it far worse.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.03.2018 02:59;0;9;Shootings don't matter. Massacres do.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.03.2018 02:57;0;1;So that guns will be banned, so that the government can abuse power much more than they already do with no recourse for the people who become victims.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;11.03.2018 02:39;0;2;Polio's decline began in the 1940s, but the vaccine wasn't introduced until a decade later. Maybe it helped, but correlation doesn't show that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.03.2018 02:38;0;3;To properly do empiric studies on vaccines, you would need to knowingly vaccinate and not vaccinate people (and not based on their consent!), and then expose both to the disease. Completely unethical. I don't know if there's a good way to solve this. (It's also not my job.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.03.2018 02:36;0;0;It's not black and white. Sometimes a vaccine makes sense. Other times, not so much. They're not a total sham.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;11.03.2018 01:07;0;2;It's more complicated than that. Even with a 100% effective vaccine, if there's a lower risk of getting the disease (eg, 0% for STDs) than the risk of harmful side effects (all vaccines inherently have non-zero risk of unknown ones, due to variations of genetics), it's a bad idea;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;7.03.2018 04:04;0;1;The Church is the supreme authority on Earth. Whether wealthy or not, it *should* have power. All States are obliged to recognise the Church as the defining source of morals upon which they ought to base their laws.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;7.03.2018 03:49;0;0;"There is no such thing as sedevacantism"". It is simply Roman Catholicism, as it has been believed and practiced for millenia. It has nothing to do with America, and far predates the global knowledge of America's existence. Wikipedia is basically bogus.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.03.2018 02:33;0;0;And even then, it's completely unreasonable to let the enemies of the Church force a rename.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.03.2018 02:32;0;0;"Many people, even a majority, mistaking Francis for a pope, does not redefine Roman Catholic"". They would need to be saying ""okay, what we used to call Roman Catholic in the first 20 centuries AD is no longer what we mean by Roman Catholic"".""";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;7.03.2018 00:39;0;0;False premise.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 23:49;0;0;Nope. When people think about the Roman Catholic Church, they think of the one that has been around for millennia, not some sect that was started a few centuries ago.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 20:59;0;0;Your dictionary is flawed. Jesus is our supreme head. And we still recognise the papacy too. History does support us.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 20:58;0;0;The Church has never murdered anyone. Your false accusations are worthless.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 20:29;0;0;Sola fide and sola scriptura are heresies unheard of before the 16th century's protestant revolution. They are alien to Christ.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 20:17;0;0;When you're ready to accept the truth, step 1 is to stop trying to rewrite history.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 20:07;0;0;Sorry, you are completely wrong. Jesus established a collective and organized/institutional Church, not individualism. Constantine wasn't even Catholic.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 20:07;0;0;The dictionary doesn't support you.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 19:29;0;1;Probably the best thing I could do practically speaking, is make arrangements to have a quickly chosen successor, and resign.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 19:28;0;1;I'm certainly not rich, and I'm sure I do a terrible job (mis)managing my money.

LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 19:26;0;0;You need to consider also that maintenance of the buildings is expensive. Some funds do need to be set aside for that. Perhaps there are better ways to manage the money, and that might leave some that can be put to good use - but I imagine it's a difficult process to oversee.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 19:24;0;0;You are the one with FUD.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 19:23;0;0;You establish consensus before deploying code.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 19:22;0;0;That's simply not true. The process for the election of a pope of the Roman Catholic Church does not result in a valid election of Francis.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 17:59;0;0;Sorry, we've been Roman Catholics since before Francis's sect existed. Taking over Vatican City and stealing our property doesn't give them a right to also steal our name, period.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 17:18;1;2;Reversing a real life transaction with fraudulent intent is a crime. That's why no matter what the method, you're only going to see demonstrations.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 17:16;0;1;Full RBF is also an option.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 17:15;0;0;It's already an option... That's why my question was about defaults. If people want FSS, someone will need to write the code.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 05:49;0;1;Pretty much. More the efficiency than anything. FSS requires every fee bump to increase the transaction size.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 05:32;0;0;"You can increase the fee. That's it.

LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 05:08;0;0;Full RBF describes the node policy, not the wallet behaviour. Nodes cannot distinguish between honest usage and dishonest usage.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 05:07;0;1;Bitcoin is at least heading in that direction.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 05:00;0;1;You mean like how Bitmain is today? Hmm. We'll have to see how things turn out, I guess. I don't see BCH doing anything to try to fix that, though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 04:59;0;1;No, they don't. BCH is not using the Bitcoin protocol. BCH is also not a trustless form of money.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 04:58;0;1;The wallet would only allow honest usage. Notice how wallets' opt-in RBF usage doesn't allow double-spends, even though it could just as easily?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 04:57;0;0;"I told the BTG folk I would only consent to work (for pay) on their altcoin if they removed Bitcoin"" from the name.

LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 04:49;0;0;Nobody does it because they have better payment systems available. Bitcoin does not yet. Lightning will solve that. Again, unconfirmed transaction insecurity is unrelated to RBF.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 04:48;0;0;Yes, protocol rules can change *with consensus*. But without consensus, you end up with creating a new altcoin like BCH. What is already not Bitcoin cannot later become Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 04:41;0;0;By the protocol rules and community consensus that constitute the same currency as was previously called Bitcoin. Same way Bitcoin has always been defined.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 04:36;0;0;Because Bitcoin is a specific currency, not any random currency that claims some properties.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 04:35;1;1;You asked. I answered. Now you want to throw FUD at me? Smells kinda like trolling...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 04:00;0;0;We are in full communion with the Catholic popes. Just because some heretics take over Vatican City doesn't make them Catholics or in charge of Catholics.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 03:58;3;39;Almost every use case... buying pizza, selling bitcoins for some cash, buying a new computer, etc. It only begins to make more sense to use on-chain when you're talking about buying cars or homes.

LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 03:56;0;1;In the world I live in, merchants happily accept credit cards which can be reversed up to 6 months later...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 03:56;0;1;That wouldn't work. There are other ways to get that effect, but the end result will just be more cloud mining, which is strictly worse. (Pooled mining isn't actually a problem at all - only the way most current pools are doing it!);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 03:55;0;1;No, that isn't what it means. It simply means that nodes with full RBF enabled won't interfere in others using full RBF. Then it's up to wallets to decide what to allow.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 03:54;0;0;That's not Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 03:23;0;0;No reason to think enabling full RBF will suddenly prompt wallet authors to enable double spending either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.03.2018 03:12;0;1;It would have had to been dead from the moment of BCH's launch. It wasn't. Thus, BCH will never be Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 21:42;0;4;Double spends are possible with or without RBF. Anti-RBF propagandists will tell you full RBF makes it easier (but it really doesn't). What you're describing is FSS RBF.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 21:37;0;0;Different, incompatible protocol and a new currency. Pseudo*-Genesis block and who got the premine is irrelevant. It's really no different than any other altcoin.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 21:22;0;1;Bitcoin is a specific currency, not just a community. BCH is a different, incompatible currency.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 20:35;2;6;That's easy. Litecoin is a certain scam. BCH is only scammy to the extent that people lie about it being Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 20:31;0;3;Bitcoin Knots has an option for full RBF. Not too late to make it default in 0.16 - if that seems desirable?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 16:24;0;0;Exactly my point. None of these few claims hold up.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 07:20;0;0;Catholicism has never evolved, and does not even permit evolution of doctrine. And for good reason: it was given to us by God, and is therefore perfect from the start.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 06:57;0;0;No, doctrine and truth are absolute constants. Kindness and humility is subject to culture and perception.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 03:55;0;2;Absolutely. Jesus did not go lightly on the heretics of His time (the Pharisees and Sadducees), nor has His Church ever tolerated heresy. Even during the times of the worst persecutions, heretics were cut off from the Christian fellowship.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 00:55;0;0;No, I would say Wikipedia is wrong about almost everything when it comes to religion.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 00:35;0;0;"My argument was never they aren't slaves"". Only that slavery is not always theft. In this case, it does seem to be theft, however.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 00:34;0;0;Regardless, it sounds like the companies Nestle works with are not in some kind of grey area - if the allegations are true, they are very clearly in the wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 00:33;0;0;If you accidentally kill a family of slaves in an automobile accident (for example), there may be an argument that you may justly be compelled to become a slave if you cannot repay the owner. But I am no expert in such topics, so I will have to defer if we go much deeper.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 00:28;0;1;Good.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 00:26;0;0;But not all slavery is theft. Sometimes historically it has been done to pay debts, for example. Other times, because the slave-owner can provide better for the slave or slave's family than the slave could provide himself. These cases are regrettable, but not theft.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 00:25;0;0;If you have ownership over yourself, you can sell that ownership to another by becoming their slave. The relevant question is, by what means was the person in question enslaved? If they were kidnapped as a previous quote you posted suggests, that is theft.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 00:18;0;0;So NOT by definition theft.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 00:13;0;0;Which there aren't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 00:11;0;0;Why do you assume I haven't?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 00:05;0;0;Okay, that sounds pretty criminal. Nestle probably should be found guilty of being an accessory at the very least, if true.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 00:04;0;1;The Church has been shown to be legitimate, not fraudulent.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.03.2018 00:04;0;0;That's not the definition I know.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.03.2018 23:55;0;0;Slavery is not necessarily theft. Are you saying that the slave owners in this case do not have a reasonable arrangement with their slaves? Perhaps there is a case to be made for that (I am ignorant on the subject).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.03.2018 23:49;0;0;He is correct.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.03.2018 23:49;0;0;If you want to get Nestle on something, I'd look at their providing baby formula to third world countries to get the babies hooked, and then charging for more... But even then, the reality is that boycotts are never morally obligatory.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.03.2018 23:47;0;0;I doubt Nestle cares one way or another whether the slave is murdered, so long as the slave-owner provides them the value they desire at the price (or lower) they agreed on.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.03.2018 23:42;0;0;"That's not even *close* to the same thing as saying Murder is fine, so long as you hire someone else to do the dirty work.""""";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;4.03.2018 23:12;0;0;That's unfortunate. I would not tithe a penny to (nor attend) a Francis-affiliated church, even if that meant I had to stay home and pray alone.

LukeDashjr;1.03.2018 17:35;0;0;All State authority comes from God. So it is God who empowers judges. And God both empowers them, and obliges them, to put His law first and foremost. Putting the US Constitution above God is a gross abuse of their power.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.03.2018 17:26;0;0;Married couples are generally obliged to seek children (but no specific required frequency to have relations). Serious medical reasons may excuse the obligation, in which case they are justified (but not obliged) to abstain. Every sex act must itself be open to life, however.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.03.2018 17:21;0;0;Violence doesn't make murder less common. Prostitution likely does make masturbation less common. Masturbation violates the very fundamental purpose of sex (procreation). It is among the worst possible sins (right up there with murder).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.03.2018 17:15;0;0;No, it is a fact. It has full legal validity, although I am sure most (if not all) judges will abuse their power to ignore it. Judges OUGHT to ignore this part of the Constitution.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.03.2018 17:14;0;0;Masturbation violates the very nature of the act, not just the marriage, since it opposes the purpose of procreation. Banning masturbation is impractical, so instead we should ban porn (bonus of no longer being a cause of innocents falling) and allow prostitution (as preferable).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.03.2018 17:12;0;0;The Constitution itself does not have unlimited authority. It is still subject to the higher laws of God. The US legal foundation is, in this sense, fundamentally flawed, and cannot morally be upheld as-is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.03.2018 17:07;0;0;To be clear, I don't think prostitution and fornication should be illegal. Rather, I only think porn and adultery should be.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.03.2018 17:05;0;0;Procreation is the necessary purpose of sex. While this might only be implicit to the couple engaging in it, wilfully trying to prevent procreation while having sex is a grave sin against the natural order for the act.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.03.2018 17:04;0;0;Government has a moral obligation to recognise Catholicism and the true religion and base its laws of Catholic principles. The First Amendment, insofar as it violates this obligation, is unjust and invalid. It is not true law, and ought to be ignored entirely.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.03.2018 17:03;0;0;(Note that Sts. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas both supported the legalisation of prostitution.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.03.2018 16:56;0;0;I agree, but the act is itself less evil because it is properly ordered in at least that respect. In other words, prostitution violates only the requirement for marriage, but porn violates both that AND the nature of the act itself (procreation).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.03.2018 16:41;0;0;I didn't say it made it good. It makes it slightly less evil. Still very evil either way.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.03.2018 16:22;0;1;No risk of accidentally hiring a prostitute either!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.03.2018 16:22;0;1;Prostitution seems at worst equally-bad as porn/masturbation, and at best slightly less bad (since the act itself may be properly ordered toward procreation). Additionally, as a physical act, it requires more deliberation, and more opportunity to resist it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;27.02.2018 13:30;0;0;That's not an excuse to leave Bitcoin broken. Good folks should understand. Manufacturers can and should prepare for possible PoW changes by making chips that can adapt for it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.02.2018 13:29;0;0;Trolls have been claiming this for months now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.02.2018 13:28;0;0;The plan is simple: change it whenever it becomes compromised. Bitcoin has never been prepared to withstand State-level attacks period.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.02.2018 13:27;0;0;No reason it should. Manufacturers can trivially prepare for a possible PoW change, and should do so even when/if none is apparently necessary.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.02.2018 13:26;0;0;If Bitmain stopped centralising Bitcoin by selling enough of their miners widely (cloud/hosted mining garbage doesn't count), I'd be all for forgiving them and moving on. The problem is that it's an ongoing problem still.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.02.2018 04:58;0;0;There is no current security. SHA2 is useless now. ANY other algorithm would be more secure overnight.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.02.2018 04:57;0;1;"PoW change solves it in the short-term by starting over and being easier for manufacturers to enter into the market; and the long-term by setting proper incentives. Sitting idle just leaves Bitcoin vulnerable for no reason and with no other hope in sight.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.02.2018 04:52;0;1;Building a miner for a new algorithm is no more effort than doing so for the current one. Likely less effort, actually.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.02.2018 03:04;0;0;The situation with Ethereum is far far worse.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.02.2018 02:44;0;1;Miner centralisation is already a present and serious problem...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.02.2018 02:43;1;2;It's not useful for anything beyond testing. The goal is to implement many algorithms, and not make a final decision on which one(s) until the latest moment possible, to avoid hostile parties having time to prepare an attack.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.02.2018 02:40;0;1;No fork exists, nor will exist, until there is consensus first.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;27.02.2018 02:37;1;1;"2) one thing which sped up the process is that Bitcoin uses the SHA2 hashing algorithm, which was designed for easy development of dedicated hardware.

LukeDashjr;27.02.2018 01:21;0;4;CPUs and GPUs are ASICs, so yes, it's impossible.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 23:47;0;1;Don't care. Impossible means impossible.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 23:46;1;2;With a new PoW algorithm, anyone can mine again. *Lots* of miners.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 19:25;0;0;But it's not looking at porn that's the problem. The problem is the publication and wilful exposure to it for sinful purposes.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 18:59;0;0;Additionally, the Church expected to undergo a situation like this. When protestants accused Rome of being the Antichrist, the response was that the real Antichrist would be a heretic posing as pope, with control of Rome, and leading a phony mockery of the Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 18:57;0;0;"Answering why"" God allows things is typically beyond human comprehension. But in this case, it is likely due to the lukewarmness and disinterest by Catholics. God gave us warnings about letting our society degrade to where it was, and we did nothing.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 18:38;0;0;B) selected Roncalli, who was strictly ineligible to become pope according to Catholic doctrine. The whole cardinal-election thing is merely discipline, and subject to doctrine.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 17:51;0;2;You're confusing history with a FICTIONAL book/movie... Jesus claimed to be God, and taught Catholicism.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 16:42;0;1;Just more FUD. Bitcoin is hard to change. That doesn't mean when we need a change, we can't or shouldn't do it. Completing this would only reaffirm the difficulty in making such changes.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 14:50;0;0;Independently. Still working on convincing my parents. Catholicism is way too broad to summarise an entire proof in a tweet or two... even a book might be pushing it, and I sure am not the one to do that.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 14:48;0;0;There's plenty of good options if we choose to start from GPUs. It may make sense to use a SHA2 variant supported by older BFL ASICs. In an ideal scenario, perhaps Halong and Samsung have variant(s) we can use instead.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 14:24;0;0;Yes, it is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 14:23;0;0;All of Catholicism is reasonably verifiable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 14:22;0;0;1) We have an obligation to seek the Truth. People who make a sincere effort to do so, generally will find it. 2) Those who do not consciously reject the Truth won't be Judged as if they did reject it, unless they should have known better.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 14:20;0;0;Uh, no. Catholics *wrote* the Bible.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 14:20;0;1;You can trivially and should support multiple algorithms from the start.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 14:19;0;0;To figure out which one is Truth, we must look at their claims, and compare to reality as we can ourselves observe it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 14:19;0;3;None of them worship the same God. That is easy enough to observe: Catholicism worships a God that became Man. Judaism rejects that same God-man.

LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 02:44;0;0;I am against the first amendment (as currently misinterpreted) because it is an unjust and invalid law. It oversteps the limits of government authority. I support the 2nd amendment because it re-enforces our inherent and natural human right to self-defense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 02:29;0;0;@ Blockstream doesn't have anywhere close to even 10% hashrate... They also don't have much (if any) influence in Core. But even if they did, it wouldn't matter, because developers have no power. Developers aren't miners.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 02:28;0;0;No, the burden of proof is on you, not me. You need to make an argument before it's even possible to refute it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 02:27;0;1;I'm going with @ RaptorEng's Talos II.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 02:26;0;8;There is no further research that can be done at this point. There is no logical basis to claim a new PoW wouldn't be immune to centralisation in at least the short term, and logically the willingness to change PoW should set the incentives correct for the long term.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 02:21;0;0;Liar.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 02:20;0;4;Everyone has an equal shot at buying up GPUs. Nobody has an unfair advantage like Bitmain does with SHA2. Botnets were never a problem [to Bitcoin] in the past.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 02:17;0;2;Ethereum's first hardfork did NOT have consensus. ETC is the real original Ethereum. If the old Bitcoin continues after a hardfork attempt, clearly it didn't really have consensus.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 02:15;0;2;"Saying we can do better"" is empty. Do better *HOW*? This problem has been ongoing for years now, and PoW change is the only viable solution we have still. And the only reason NOT to do it, is FUD.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 02:14;0;5;Any other ASIC-friendly algorithm would be fine. Yes, if someone re-centralises the new one, we change again and again until people figure out trying to centralise it is stupid and won't be good for them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 02:11;0;1;An algo change is a miner change. That's the point. And no, miners do not contribute to value - they only take away from it at this point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 02:10;0;0;SHA2 hashing power is completely worthless for other algorithms.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 02:10;0;0;There are many viable alternatives. SHA2 isn't special at all.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 02:03;0;0;No, only because they control too much hashrate. That alone is more than a big enough issue.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 01:28;0;3;Bcash will already be simply bcash. Never bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.02.2018 01:27;3;23;That's why those of us who support it are working on education and establishing consensus, NOT deploying contentious code.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 23:56;5;28;The part that confuses people is that if you attempt a hardfork without consensus, you end up with an altcoin instead.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 23:52;2;12;Hardforks are when an existing system changes (in a non-backwards compatible way). New systems are just altcoins, never hardforks.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 23:22;0;8;"Someone voted no""?!?!?!""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 21:12;0;0;I didn't say it was likely.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 21:10;0;0;Yes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 20:47;0;0;If the original Bitcoin chain continues to exist, the fork has failed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 20:47;0;0;We're not even headed in the right direction, so infinite time remaining?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 20:36;0;0;I mean there can only ever be one chain with actual usage. If people continue to use the current Bitcoin rules after the PoW change activates, the PoW change has failed and become an altcoin. Bitcoin remains as it was. This is why it's crucial to get consensus first.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 20:21;0;1;I have little expectation that the community will change its mind at this point. So long as that is the case, we cannot act. But the facts remain that it is something we SHOULD be doing, and as such, I will support an effort to do so, so long as it isn't yet another altcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 20:16;0;0;"The community has fallen victim to FUD that PoW changes are nuclear"" or somehow drastic.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 20:05;0;2;This is nonsense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 20:04;0;1;Only users and merchants matter. There is no need to convince miners. Wallets, exchanges and developers exist only to serve the users, and must do what the users want. PoW change is much smaller than Segwit. There is no work to upgrade.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 19:58;0;1;Testnet coins don't have value. If you can spend them, they're not testnet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 19:58;0;0;I don't see the point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 19:56;0;0;"There wasn't even a problem in 2013 (to be solved by the hardfork). It was simply a new feature; one that in hindsight should have been rejected.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 19:54;0;1;In that case, please send some of your testnet BCH and BTG coins to me free of charge...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 19:36;0;1;Perhaps, but that's not what happened.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 19:26;0;2;BCH and BTG are not hardforks either. They are just altcoins. Not notably any different from the altcoins before them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 19:25;0;1;Probably similar tohttps://github.com/BitcoinHardfork/bitcoin …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 19:24;0;0;That's not true. It is an altcoin, and nothing more.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 19:24;0;1;The goal is to get rid of any single/few entities who can control the network, no matter who or how. No one entity should control more than 10% total hashrate. No one country should have more than 30% either physically or remotely controlled from within its borders.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 19:23;0;1;No, it isn't. It was never intended to be, nor would a PoW change hardfork be done in that manner.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 19:22;0;3;Those are altcoins, not PoW changes or hardforks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 19:22;0;2;Taxes are much higher for income, than for long-term capital gains... I pay my taxes, but not much more than I'm required to!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 19:21;0;0;Bingo.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 19:20;0;0;If Jihan wanted to, he could solve the problem overnight by diversely liquidating Bitmain's miner stock. Then we wouldn't even need a PoW change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 19:19;0;0;That doesn't follow at all. There has been no need for a hardfork since 2013 until the need for PoW change arose.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 19:17;0;1;No, Bitcoin would have had to cease to exist at the moment of BCH's launch. That didn't happen. BCH is strictly an altcoin now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 19:16;0;1;No, BGold is an altcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 16:06;0;2;Incompatibility with older nodes. If the original network continues to exist, the attempt to hardfork has failed and turned into an altcoin instead.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 16:05;0;0;Many. But only one (in 2013 May) since it has gained notable value.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 16:03;0;4;Depends on what algorithm we change to. Assuming only GPUs can mine at first, the situation would be MUCH BETTER than it is today with SHA2. Hashpower in numbers matters less than diversity of miners.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 16:01;0;0;The Bitcoin community as a whole decides. So long as Bitcoin as-is continues to exist, any attempt to hardfork will result in yet another altcoin like BCH being created instead of Bitcoin itself being changed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 16:01;0;0;I don't recall what the market cap was in 2013. Are you saying Bitcoin value will need to drop to that level before the community will act to protect it?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 15:59;1;0;Maybe. But softforks aren't much better than hardforks when virtually all mining hashrate will oppose it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 15:57;0;0;Hopefully they will just switch to BCH. Again, centralised hashrate doesn't make security.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 15:55;0;1;It's a can of worms. There's no rational basis to say two algorithms are equivalent at any hashrates.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 15:55;0;0;Can of worms. How do you compare two diverged chains?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 15:54;0;0;The difference is, I'm not going to do it, unless the network chooses it first.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 15:53;0;0;SHA2 has been centralised for years now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 15:52;0;1;ASICs aren't the problem. The primary concern isn't number of manufacturers either, but who is actually running the miners. Right now, it's mostly a handful of people. If SHA2 becomes commoditized properly some day, we can talk about switching back. Changes can be both ways.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 15:49;0;4;The tonal system's advantages are all practical, though... (at least the ones I perceive - maybe there's a beauty I overlook as well?);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 15:48;0;0;No, I had to write my own script to do it. Unfortunately, it's highly specific to my own exports. Maybe some day I will find a way to generalise it, but it seems like a big project. :(;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 15:47;0;0;Yes, it is. That's what a real hardfork is. (BCH is not a hardfork.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 15:45;0;2;"No, it's a comment that exposes the shortcomings of using the term fork"" for so many different things.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 06:16;0;1;Why merely hope and do nothing? Changing PoW doesn't inhibit their entry, and if they choose a different algorithm, we can always change [back] to that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 06:15;0;0;It wouldn't even be difficult. Just a few extra transistors, really. At least first-gen BFL hardware supported one, although it would be a pain to use (you'd need to disassemble the units to modify the firmware).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:56;0;2;No, you're ridiculous.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:56;0;0;The backup algorithm would be a variant of SHA2 that isn't practical for competition to also support unaware of its existence. When the community agrees to change PoW, then we would just use these backup algorithms instead of SHA2.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:55;0;0;Even 6 months, in the worst case scenario. But it sets a precedent that heavily dis-incentivises doing so.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:54;0;2;The community changes the algorithm, not developers. Even if it wasn't likely to be necessary (which it clearly is today), a reasonable manufacturer that cares about Bitcoin's success would build in a backup just in case.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:42;0;2;Ignoring my point doesn't make it any less valid.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:35;0;1;Which is why we need to work on strong consensus for a PoW change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:35;0;6;If manufacturers X, Y, and Z make SHA2 ASICs, which also support SHA2+X, SHA2+Y, and SHA2+Z, then when we stop allowing SHA2, we would want to use instead (SHA2+X or SHA2+Y) if it is SHA2+Z that is acting abusively/centralising the network.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:33;0;4;Are you asserting that the competition has incompetently ignored the advice to support a backup algorithm?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:32;0;1;Not much, and only for the better.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:28;0;0;Why not? It's Coinbase that is providing the information, and it only makes sense to be sure they're aware they need to report it CORRECTLY.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:26;0;0;Bitcoin has hardforked before just fine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:24;0;1;FIFO and LILO are literally the same thing...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:23;0;0;Everyone using Bitcoin will want to mine it to keep it safe. The way it was always intended to be!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:21;0;7;If you don't have consensus, there can be no hardfork in the first place. That's beside the point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:20;0;0;Large hashrate is irrelevant if it's centralised. Also, you can't even *compare* different algorithms.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:15;0;4;Not if the competition paid attention to the advice ASIC manufacturers have been given since 2011: to support a backup algorithm. And we've had competition before. They went out of business.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:13;0;1;Sounds like a good way to lose your privacy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:03;0;0;BGold is an altcoin, not Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:02;0;0;PoW change isn't a big change at all. It is much less significant than Segwit or even P2SH.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:02;0;0;FUD. It is not radical at all. Just a minor change. SHA2 isn't particularly special.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 05:00;0;4;That's one option. But hopefully @ HalongMining built them to support a secondary/backup algorithm in case of PoW change. That's been the advice given to ASIC manufacturers since 2011.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 04:58;0;0;None of the above...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.02.2018 04:58;1;2;That's more FUD. Changing the PoW is less of a change than adding Segwit was.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 23:57;0;5;No. This is FUD. There is nothing nuclear about a PoW change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 22:05;1;9;Why would someone re-centralise, when it's clear the community will change PoW as needed to prevent it? They would lose their investment. And even if they did anyway despite that, it would take several months at least.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 22:03;1;3;Mining isn't meant to be invested it. It's meant to be done by everyone* as an expense to keep the network secure. Investors should build mining hardware because people are willing to buy it from them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 22:02;0;1;I can't predict the future, but as things are, Bitcoin is sinkING. There's no benefit to fixing the problems later rather than sooner.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:59;0;0;Except there are actual reasons not to touch those.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:59;23;69;A change of PoW is needed because SHA2 is no longer a decentralised PoW, but has become merely assigned-by-Bitmain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:57;0;2;Of course not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:57;0;2;I hope so. My documentation is annoyingly much, though...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:57;0;1;He's not poking holes. He's pointing out holes that already exist, and suggesting we plug them before we sink.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:56;0;0;Yes. We've done it before, and we can do it again. Just a matter of getting consensus.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:56;1;10;And such a fork isn't a fork of Bitcoin, it's a fork *within* Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:55;1;9;Sure, but that's beside the point. The network has never chosen to do a PoW change fork so far. That's no argument that it can't or shouldn't do one soon.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:54;0;0;That's another matter entirely.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:53;0;3;Protect the brand from what? Cobra's valid points, and efforts to protect Bitcoin itself?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:52;0;0;But in this case, it's rightfully judging the guilty. China *does* prohibit Catholicism.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:51;0;5;Apparently not (but I don't know how to explain it, being somewhat beauty-blind myself).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:51;0;0;"I hope so. Are you sure? Their web reports seem to suggest they report withdrawls as sales"" and deposits as ""buying bitcoins""...""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:50;0;7;I hear IRS audits are a pretty annoying scenario, however.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:49;0;3;Cost basis refers to the price at which you acquired the bitcoins later sold/spent. Coinbase's online reports, however, seem to use the price when you moved them into your Coinbase account instead. Similarly, they also seem to report withdrawls from your account as sales.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:47;1;10;Irrelevant. PoW change for Bitcoin isn't a fork of Bitcoin. It is a change to Bitcoin itself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:43;0;1;Randomly? This has been an ongoing topic for months, if not years.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:41;0;5;Seriously? AR-15s are just standard rifles.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:40;1;25;Regardless of whether this is true or not, it shouldn't be a factor in considering the merits or demerits of @ CobraBitcoin's articles and ideas.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.02.2018 21:38;0;16;I spent many decades thinking only practical things mattered. I'm still coming to terms with the concept that beauty is itself important. (But I still think people don't need make-up, jewelry, etc to be beautiful.);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.02.2018 20:02;0;0;When people have guns, someone would have to be insane to even try a shooting in the first place, so they simply won't happen.

LukeDashjr;23.02.2018 20:01;0;0;Gun control makes it *more* likely to happen, not less. The only reason we have school shootings like this in the first place is because schools already have strict gun control.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;20.02.2018 19:46;0;0;Also, be sure to exclude self-defense killing too. Criminals being killed in the attempt shouldn't count against guns. (Especially in places like Florida where we're *required* to shoot to kill in such circumstances.);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.02.2018 18:05;0;1;At the same time, screening can be harmful: the entity doing the background check now de facto knows about every gun purchase made.

LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:55;0;0;On the contrary, places with fewer guns have higher crime rates.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:55;0;0;Again with the lies. Guns are NOT made the harm people.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:54;0;1;The criminals choose their victims. With no guns in the picture, they will obviously choose someone they can be certain to overpower.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:40;0;0;I'm not aware of that being true. If it's totalitarian, are you sure information about it isn't simply being censored?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:35;0;1;Without guns, the victim has no chance.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:33;0;0;No, it isn't. The other way around is true.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:32;0;0;Sorry, but if you think gunless people are harmless, you're just plain delusional...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:30;0;1;If taking their life is necessary to defending my rights from their wilful assault, then yes, I am justified in doing so.

LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:29;0;5;If you need mental health care, you can get it. The problem is they very often misdiagnose and put people on drugs that they don't need, which ends up creating even worse mental problems.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:27;0;2;It's far too combined. The US has a lot of regions where guns are banned, and those regions are responsible for the highest murder rates. At the very least, take it State-by-State.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:24;0;0;Guns are not created for harming/killing people.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:23;0;0;It is a fact that many more people are protected from harm because individuals own guns. Removing guns does not make harming people any harder.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:22;0;0;Governments always fail at protecting people on a local level. You'd need a huge amount of the population policing constantly to be effective at that. Otherwise, the crime is over before the cops show up.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:21;0;0;Showed every statistic, you mean. School shootings happen because guns are banned from schools.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:20;0;0;Without guns, criminals WILL try because they know they will succeed with 90+% success rate. With enough guns, criminals will have to consider the risk of their victim being armed, and WON'T try (at least not as often).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:17;0;1;Your error is assuming gun violence matters more than non-gun violence.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:16;0;0;Guns are also created for living. Everyone should be trained.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:14;0;0;It's pretty likely that the too-easy access to mental health care providers is at least at fault...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:12;0;0;There's plenty of vehicular homicides too. The mass media just doesn't make as much of a big deal about them, because it doesn't fit their agenda of banning guns.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:11;0;0;I guess we will probably never meet then. Even when I can't carry myself, I prefer to only be places where I know someone else is, and can defend us if needed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:10;0;6;If nobody has guns, criminals will just use knives or their bare hands. Since they choose the victim, they can be near certain to always pick someone they know they can overpower. Guns in the hands of the would-be victims break this advantage.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:07;0;2;Murder rate is higher in countries that ban guns. Try again.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:07;0;0;You keep repeating this false claim. Repetition doesn't make it true.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:03;0;1;Yes they do.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:02;0;0;Obviously for hunting.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 04:02;0;0;You have it backward.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 01:49;0;2;Most people don't try. The ones that do, go behind bars. And no, you're not any more likely to fail without a gun. Guns just prevent you from succeeding when the other person has one.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 01:44;0;0;Welcome to reality, where people don't hurt each other over quarrels... Guns or not, if you do that, you'll go to jail.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 01:42;0;3;Eg, school shootings;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 01:39;0;2;No. The tragedies are in places that ban guns.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 01:28;0;0;Obviously. Nobody said children can all handle guns. The law is because liberal tyrants wrote it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 01:25;0;0;I wouldn't *stop* my older children from carrying a knife - there's just no reason to do it. The law prohibits me from letting them carry a handgun.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 01:23;0;2;Just because you don't like the conclusion doesn't make the analogy bad. (I think we should require every adult with care of someone else to carry a gun.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 01:20;0;0;You never know when you'll need it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 01:19;0;1;Knives are not effective for protection.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 01:17;0;1;Again, you are still wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 01:16;0;4;Guns protect life.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 01:08;0;0;The point of that was that the vaccine vs anti-vaccine debate is irrelevant to the comparison. Guns are still good. Not looking to get distracted from the topic here. It's about guns, not vaccines.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 01:06;0;0;30 rounds is a reasonable number for any gun. Semi-automatic just means it reloads for you. The kind of round you load in it isn't an attribute of a gun.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.02.2018 01:05;0;5;The purpose of guns is not to kill people at all. Guns enable untrained people also. And finally, most people are probably trained, considering it is typically a requirement to get a carry license, and (at least in Florida) 1 in 3 people have such a license.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.02.2018 05:02;0;0;In that scenario, you're not killing the baby. You simply cannot prevent his death.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;14.02.2018 15:34;0;0;Thus far, we have been able to improve it about 17% per year. That's only enough to justify 300k blocks. If we couldn't improve it, block size would need to be 0 and that obviously wouldn't work.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.02.2018 15:31;0;1;Premature delivery is not inherently evil. The evil would come only from an evil intention to harm the child.

LukeDashjr;14.02.2018 06:26;0;0;Don't talk as if murder is logical. It isn't. This isn't about who lives and who dies. It's about not usurping God's right to make that call.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;14.02.2018 05:18;0;0;Not always easy, but very clear in the case of abortion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.02.2018 05:15;0;1;Why do you need to prove intent to defraud a *specific* buyer? Prosecution of fraud is done by the State, so it shouldn't matter who the victim(s) are.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;13.02.2018 06:09;0;0;During Jesus's time on Earth, He established an institution for the purposes of teaching His doctrine and caring for the salvation of souls. This institution (the Church) is identified by four marks: 1) Unity of faith: all Catholics believe the same doctrine.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;13.02.2018 06:05;0;0;I mean the Catholic Church did not approve of it. Since it was written by non-Catholics in their efforts to mock the Church, and is known to contain heresy, it is unlikely that will ever change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.02.2018 06:04;0;0;I have plenty of reason to know that is true. Just because you don't like the conclusion doesn't mean the reasons don't exist.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;12.02.2018 03:52;1;2;I'm guessing he's comparing it to checkpoints, which Satoshi indeed meant as a safeguard against large reorganizations. Not quite the same thing though - checkpoints are only set after the decentralised consensus has already been long-established.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.02.2018 03:44;0;3;In the near term. But long-term, I have to admit a block size increase probably needs to happen. The important thing is that we need the system to scale properly FIRST.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.02.2018 03:43;0;0;Shogi is a slightly more complicated variant of chess. Main differences are a 9x9 board (instead of 8x8), only one bishop, and 2 new kinds of units: silver and gold generals. And some kind of unit promotion system, which I haven't fully wrapped my head around yet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.02.2018 03:42;0;16;No, it wouldn't have proved that. Only proved that the majority of the network is vulnerable to such attacks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.02.2018 03:41;1;15;Light wallets, when not paired with a full node the user runs himself, are vulnerable to being fed invalid blocks. 2X would have been an altcoin forming its blocks specifically to take advantage of this vulnerability, such that it fools such wallets into thinking it is Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 23:17;0;0;How so?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 23:10;0;0;They have no control.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 22:23;0;0;Dunno, ask them. My point is that it doesn't matter. Are we talking about Bitcoin or Blockstream?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 22:23;0;0;It's several hours, even with the best hardware. Many people don't want to spend the time, regardless of the financial cost.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 22:05;0;0;People who don't, generally give the cost of doing so as the reason.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 22:04;0;0;Blockstream is a for-profit company. It is not Bitcoin, and does not control Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:49;0;0;Ethereum's approach is clearly wrong. Bitcoin wouldn't likely have been any better off if Satoshi hadn't disabled the opcodes - very few people have ever shown any interest in (actually useful) smart contracts to date.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:48;0;0;Again, they have *already proven* to be this detrimental. Spam is *already an issue* - that's why your fees are high!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:47;0;0;Uh, yes it does. The only reason not to run a node yourself, is if the cost to do so is too high.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:46;0;0;Segwit does not remove anything from transactions or blocks at all. It only skips the signatures when calculating the transaction id, which is fundamentally what fixing third-party malleability entails (there is probably no other way to do it).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:44;0;0;I imagine Adam is busy with being a CEO. I imagine if he contributed, it'd also be used as ammo for the FUD claims about Blockstream trying to control Core. I don't pay much attention to Blockstream's funding sources.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:43;0;0;Blockstream pays only two developers at this point, and has never exerted any influence over the direction of their work (or anyone else's) on Bitcoin Core as far as I know. That's 100% pure FUD.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:25;0;0;The limit is to prevent miners from spamming too much, yes. But even 1 MB has proven to be too high a limit. Regardless, the limit isn't what is the cause of fees - the spam is. The spam will be a problem with bigger blocks too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:24;0;1;People began adopting Bitcoin long before it was ready. The only thing we can do is continue to work toward making it ready. More developers would be helpful...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:23;0;0;It hasn't so far. Bitcoin already has far too few nodes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:17;0;0;"a) Developers don't decide protocol changes. b) There are serious problems with block size increases. c) No research has shown that; it is clearly false.https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/61yvvv/request_to_core_devs_please_explain_your_vision/dficjhj/ …";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:14;0;0;It is a historical fact at this point, that the community largely rejected BCH's attempt to change the rules in August, resulting in BCH forming a new and separate currency. That will never change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:13;0;0;The chain's work is irrelevant to the currency. The currency is defined first and foremost by the rules that enable nodes to come to consensus on the state of the system. The only way Bitcoin can be changed, is by the entire community going along with it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:12;0;0;There is a real reason to hope for Bitcoin's long term success. As such, those who sell bitcoins are not doing so fraudulently. Even if Bitcoin later fails, it was not a scam, but an honest effort with reasonable hope of success.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:11;0;1;(Already, the improvements made by Segwit are sufficient to enable Lightning, which is itself a smart contract based system.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:10;0;2;11/ Simply false. Segwit does not do what they claim. 12/ Satoshi disabled the mentioned opcodes. Bitcoin took a first step to restoring this functionality with Segwit, and progress is constantly made in that direction with MAST and similar.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:08;1;1;10/ Completely backward. While Bitcoin has ceased to be censorship resistant due to miner centralisation, the situation with BCH is far worse. Lightning is only an improvement to censorship resistance.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:07;0;1;9/ Bitcoin doesn't prevent combining as claimed. Incentives are an issue, but they are also an issue for BCH since they just copied Bitcoin in this respect. (Note that the incentive issue has been partially fixed moving forward in Bitcoin by Segwit.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:06;0;2;8/ False. There are SOME dev centralisation issues we face, but not the ones claimed here, & not ones that harm Bitcoin. It would be better if Core had less of a monopoly (there are alternatives), but at the end of the day, the community is deciding what software they will run.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:05;0;1;6/ It's easy to gain merchants when you have none, and easier to lose merchants when you have many. BCH launched in 2017, whereas Bitcoin has been around since 2009. 7/ Unfounded and false claim.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:00;0;1;5/ Bitcoin has never supported secure instant transactions, and blockchain technology alone doesn't make them possible. RBF was broken, but included in the original Bitcoin software. (Lightning does actually add the feature of secure instant transactions.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 21:00;0;1;3/ Cheap, fast, and secure aren't all possible under the conditions Bitcoin is experiencing. BCH has abandoned any effort to be secure, while Bitcoin has TEMPORARILY lost cheap. 4/ Bitcoin was designed from day 1 for off-chain payment channels.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 20:53;0;0;Also, the claims of censorship are mostly FUD. Some Bitcoin forums want to only have conversations about Bitcoin, not altcoins, and that's understandable - we should stick to forums that are okay with talking about BCH, if we want to discuss BCH.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 20:51;0;1;The only reason I'm aware of that BCH might be considered a scam, is because its proponents try to fraudulently pass it off as Bitcoin.

LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 20:50;0;0;BCH's direction is fundamentally different from Bitcoin's, so note that this typical reason probably does NOT apply to BCH, so long as the BCH developers actually move forward in some new way. (It's the reason for most altcoins being scams, however, including Litecoin).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.02.2018 20:48;0;0;Currencies are naturally scams unless they get significant, long-term real-world adoption. Otherwise, when the currency fails, every gain someone made, was at the expense of someone else who had an equal loss. In other words, it's a zero-sum game.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;1.02.2018 08:53;0;0;Able and willing are two different things.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.02.2018 02:15;0;0;See 2X for an example attack that could succeed if done in secret.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.02.2018 02:14;0;0;That's not relevant. It's users that aren't running their own full node either way.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.02.2018 02:14;0;0;Too many are unable to run full nodes with 1 MB blocks. Even the 2-4 MB increase bundled with Segwit was too much.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.01.2018 21:39;0;0;Yes, as well as users using Coinbase or other such shared wallets.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.01.2018 21:23;1;9;It's not that important. Bitcoin itself loses its network-wide security if non-full nodes make up much more than ~15% of the network.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.01.2018 20:06;0;7;You're correct.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.01.2018 19:42;0;2;A fixed size of 3 MB is already a 100% increase to the blockchain size over the next year.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 16:57;0;1;Spam sets the fee floor, correct. That has always been the case.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 16:02;0;2;Except Segwit + LN actually resembles the whitepaper better...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 16:01;0;2;If you convert.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 15:59;0;0;In the same scope, they are exclusive. A hardfork is a type of change to an existing system. When you're making a new system, that isn't a hardfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 15:58;0;0;Lightning reduces the on-chain data requirements of legitimate usage, such that spam pushing fees up will matter much less to real users.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 15:58;0;2;"That's my point. Modern computers themselves are more complicated than all of Bitcoin (including Lightning) combined.

LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 07:14;0;1;"The whitepaper didn't go into much details at all.

LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 07:13;0;0;Sure you can. Besides, Bitcoin already depends on many people being online. If all the nodes shut off, it wouldn't work anymore.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 07:09;0;1;I guess you'd better go back to using an abacus then (or maybe finger math). General-purpose computers are insanely complex in comparison to both the blockchain *and* Lightning. Just look at Spectre! P.S. Lightning is PART of Bitcoin, not something separate.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 07:01;0;2;The only ways Lightning affects UX is: 1) instant confirmation, 2) lower fees, and 3) lower resource requirements.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 06:58;0;0;And even if it were true, BCH would still be an altcoin, since it still isn't Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 06:57;0;1;"Your premise (that BCH follows the paper strictly"") is false.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 06:56;0;2;Bitcoin was designed with such a second layer in mind, and the second layer doesn't take away from any of the properties described in the whitepaper (it only improves them).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 06:55;0;3;The whitepaper never went into the structure of data (ironically, the pseudo-structure pictures are a closer match to Segwit than the original structure). Block size was always capped, and must be capped to have a working system.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 06:50;0;0;Ironically, that's what we ended up with (BIP148).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 06:49;0;0;"Yes and no. He's talking about two things here. One is a prediction that tech improvements will keep up with adoption; that failed around 300k block sizes. The other is a prediction that miners will move to GPUs. That did happen, but we're long past that now.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 06:27;0;1;The actual resource requirements for transactions is too high. Lightning brings that down.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 06:26;0;0;Block headers are 80 bytes no matter what the block size is. The whitepaper is correct that it will almost never be a problem to store headers. Totally irrelevant to the topic, however.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 06:26;0;8;No, Lightning is a p2p layer-2. It only *improves* the currency property. Moores Law has never applied to bandwidth, and never held true for the overall needs of Bitcoin. Besides, it would only allow for a doubling every so often, which is currently 2-3 MB blocks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 06:13;3;12;"With Bitcoin... 1) You can actually be a peer still, by running a full node; 2) Lightning is *actually* peer-to-peer (whereas blockchains are merely flood/broadcast). BCH's road is lacking in both. With BCH, you will soon only be able to be a light wallet trusting someone else.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 06:05;0;5;You sound confused. BCH is NOT a closer match in the first place.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 05:54;2;51;Because nothing has been fixed. As soon as the spammer(s) start up again, fees will rise (unless we get Lightning deployed first).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 05:13;5;55;"It's still wrong. Segwit does NOT split transactions, and does NOT make them more compact. And BCH is NOT a hardfork; it is an altcoin.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.01.2018 01:32;0;6;You bring the pizza now? All the way to Florida, I hope??? :D;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:58;0;0;They certainly would if they didn't confirm on the new chain, after a reorg!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:54;0;0;That you refuse to discuss rationally, and continue making false claims and ignoring the facts, does make you a troll.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:54;0;0;That's nothing short of a lie.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:53;0;0;Any merchants adopting BCH (most of which retain their support of Bitcoin) are doing so as a separate currency, not as a reorganization of the Bitcoin chain. Nobody is claiming transactions confirmed on Bitcoin, but not on BCH, are fraudulent or counterfeit.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:50;0;1;No, because you are trolling, and this is getting more and more obvious. I will probably just block you, after it has become obvious enough that any reader will see it too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:49;0;0;It's not ridiculously specific - it's specific enough to be clear and to the point, so that it serves the purpose for which it was intended: to describe a kind of CHANGE to an EXISTING system. When you make a new system, it isn't that at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:49;0;0;The economy ALREADY didn't follow BCH. You can't change the past in the future. This is common sense, not special pleading.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:45;0;0;Irrelevant.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:44;0;0;Except your argument is not logical at all, and your conclusions are all wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:41;0;0;That doesn't follow, no.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:41;0;0;No, they are exactly the same thing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:40;0;0;It's not special pleading to refer to an attribute that is part of the definition. Are you trolling?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:38;0;0;It wouldn't sync with the current blockchain because we had a hardfork in 2013. If you used a circa 2013 client, it would sync just fine. Yes, if you starting mining an old chain, you'd be making an altcoin, because the economy has already moved on.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:36;0;0;The difference between altcoins and hardforks has ALWAYS been adoption by the economy. That's why they're two different things in the first place.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:31;0;0;No, you're simply wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:29;0;0;You asked what it's called. And no, it wasn't created by hardfork. Anyone calling BCH a hardfork doesn't know what a hardfork is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:29;0;0;No, the weight calculation makes more sense than the byte calculation in some ways, and we will need larger blocks eventually. Users should simply avoid using Segwit when malleability is not a problem, and miners should soft-limit their blocks to 750k until more is needed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:26;0;0;It would be a failed hardfork attempt that resulted in an altcoin. (Assuming the original chain continued to be used as well. Miners don't decide things, the economy does.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:26;0;0;Modifying open source software to make an altcoin. Just as the thousands of altcoins before it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:25;0;0;Because Segwit is a feature, and one that should only be used when needed due to the harmful side-effects. It is unlikely there will be a legitimate use case for Segwit until Lightning is production-ready.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:22;0;0;Separate and new. That it accepts old blocks is irrelevant.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:19;0;0;I never claimed hardforks by definition creation altcoins... BCH is not a hardfork. It is ONLY an altcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:18;0;0;It's better to not use Segwit, because when you don't care about malleability, the only effect is increasing the block size, which is harmful to Bitcoin's decentralisation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:18;0;0;It would have failed because Segwit only had ~80% support, not consensus. So the 20% remaining would have continued using the pre-Segwit Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:17;0;0;But this is entirely unrelated to the fact that BCH is a completely separate and new system, whereas Segwit was not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:16;0;0;Segwit is as backwards compatible as *any* softfork is: old nodes will accept the Segwit chain as valid. If you use such an old node to send a Segwit-invalid transaction, yes, that node will rebroadcast it, but it will never get into the blockchain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:12;0;0;Sounds like you're just admitting you lied in the premise that BCH itself hardforked.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:11;0;0;No, it would have most likely failed and turned into an altcoin. Not to mention that it's better for people NOT to be using Segwit today.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:10;0;0;Nobody said the consensus rules weren't changed. This is a straw-man.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:08;1;1;"Maybe so. I'm not familiar with Bitcoin Clashic"".""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:07;0;0;Segwit was backward compatible, so the previous system was inherently replaced by the new one. If you ran the previous node, it would follow along with the Segwit chain as-is. This is why softforks are fundamentally more practical to deploy.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:04;0;0;Now you're just denying facts. When BCH started, it DID create a new system. To claim a hardfork, you need to show that the original system ceased to exist, but when BCH began, Bitcoin continued on as normal. It isn't even debatable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 23:00;0;0;Both of your examples are changes to an existing system. But when BCH was created, it wasn't a change to an existing system, it was the creation of a new system.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 22:52;0;0;That you think those points contradict what I said, just shows you don't know what you're talking about.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 22:47;0;0;"If you don't like the definition of the term hardfork"", then just don't use the term at all. It doesn't justify lying about it.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 22:46;0;0;Everyone needs to process the blockchain to use Bitcoin at all, with or without Lightning.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 22:26;0;0;Nope.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 22:26;0;1;It is the very definition of an altcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 22:26;0;0;You don't know what you're talking about. It depends on nothing other than other hard facts.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 22:25;0;0;LOL, no. The map only changes when there's opening/closing of channels, which is on-chain. Everyone ALREADY needs to have the entire blockchain, so this is something we can just ASSUME as a premise for any Bitcoin-based system. And right now, that has a hard limit of 576 MB/day.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 15:44;0;1;No, I'm stating a fact.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 15:31;0;1;No, BCH was set to activate on Aug 1 regardless of what Bitcoin did.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 15:29;0;1;Now this is just FUD...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.01.2018 15:28;0;3;"You don't know that, and even if so, correlation is not causation. The cause of BCH was a human decision, not Segwit. Additionally, BCH was not a hardfork either; it was a new altcoin launch. A hardfork is a CHANGE to Bitcoin, not a new currency.";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.01.2018 06:43;0;0;So, VISA?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.01.2018 06:43;0;3;I don't really know a good way to learn Bitcoin/related other than working on Bitcoin itself. Or at least studying how it all works.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.01.2018 05:00;0;0;Which is nonsense. The softfork was a strict improvement over the earlier hardfork design.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.01.2018 04:46;0;0;If they're going to admit they were wrong, they should just merge Segwit in a compatible manner rather than being incompatible with everything else...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.01.2018 04:45;0;0;It's centralised today, but not beyond hope of recovery, especially with a block size decrease in the future.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.01.2018 04:40;0;0;Maybe unless you get provably deterministic signatures, but the Bitcoin developer community tried that first and didn't find a way to prove it was even possible.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.01.2018 04:39;0;0;By definition, any fix is just another form of Segwit.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.01.2018 04:38;0;0;No, please learn logic. It's not inevitable for Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.01.2018 04:30;0;0;And BCH was formed explicitly to avoid fixing transaction malleability (no matter how you do it, you end up with Segwit, even if you go out the way to make it gratuitously incompatible to lie that it isn't Segwit).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.01.2018 23:58;0;3;Yes, the design kinda sucks despite that. I didn't say it wasn't a significant IMPROVEMENT (it was/is).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.01.2018 06:44;0;1;Haha. Bitmain sees the opportunity to make money screwing over scamcoin miners. That doesn't mean anything positive for the scamcoin... And Litecoin proves you wrong. It's been the second target of ASICs ever, and it's just another copypasta scamcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.01.2018 06:33;0;1;Scamcoins have no legitimate market value in the first place, so the only relationship to price is pumping and dumping. Undoubtedly, the scammers will try to pump using anything they can to justify the pump, regardless of rationality. There's nothing to learn from this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.01.2018 06:27;0;1;That REDUCES security, not increases.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.01.2018 06:27;0;0;That's nonsense. Hashrate follows price. Price does not follow hashrate.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.01.2018 23:47;0;2;Nobody did. Not Blockstream. Not a single Core dev. JUST the big blockers. And NYA nonsense was after Segwit was already a certainty thanks to the UASF.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.01.2018 22:39;0;1;I think Electrum supports the Trezor, so you could run an ElectrumX Server on your full node system, and use that.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.01.2018 05:01;0;0;1) You never send bitcoins FROM an address. Addresses ONLY receive. 2) It's better NOT to use Segwit at this point in time.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.01.2018 04:26;0;0;No idea, sorry.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.01.2018 04:17;0;7;A better argument is that the security concerns with Drivechain are true of federated sidechains also, and those can't be stopped anyway.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.01.2018 04:11;0;7;Not really. Segwit doesn't have security concerns...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.01.2018 03:16;0;3;Yes, especially macOS and anything Apple makes...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 20:05;0;3;No, it was over safe changes like Segwit that actually improved the situation (by enabling Lightning) vs unsafe changes like hardforks that didn't actually help.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 20:01;0;0;If they're not all talk, maybe some day they will do something innovative. (But so far, they haven't.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 14:16;0;0;Not for just that. But last time I checked, they generated extra transactions for no purpose, and that would count if they're still doing that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 14:12;0;2;Pretty low.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 13:29;0;1;No. Don't spam me, scammer.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 12:54;0;0;The outcome of that is probably worse than they had with banks, at least long-term.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 12:43;0;0;Maybe they don't want their money disappearing out from under them overnight some day?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 12:39;0;0;No.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 12:30;0;0;Sure. I just figured some kind of bluetooth pairing would be easier to setup than trying to pair it by hand.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 12:26;0;0;Sure, you only need a sync'd node for receiving.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 12:25;0;1;That's basically what I mean.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 12:19;0;0;And why is it a problem if you have a small device at home assisting your phone over the internet?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 12:01;0;0;Additionally, if the node-on-a-phone thing turns out to not be practical anyway, it's quite possible to build appliance nodes you can just plug in at home, and pair with your phone. This is probably a better approach anyway, since it can also give you a more secure wallet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 12:00;0;0;Lightning, MAST, and signature aggregation will make transactions much smaller. In addition to reducing fees, this also should mean block sizes can get smaller without disrupting any legitimate usage, hopefully enough to let technology catch up to the blockchain size.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 11:59;2;7;"Reducing data usage per transaction; so, things like Lightning, MAST, and aggregated signatures.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 11:42;0;0;Anyone can mine. The only thing keeping most people out today, is the competition from the big miners. If the big miners go away, it gets easier for everyone else to jump in and do the job.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 11:41;0;0;More or less. Not only would it not include users, but users wouldn't even necessarily be aware of it until it's too late.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 11:25;0;0;Because they are completely insecure, and will put economic pressure to hardfork away ALL the rules if miners ask them to (and they won't even be aware of doing it). Censorship, inflation, stealing bitcoins - all possible if a majority don't use their own full node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 11:16;0;0;Segwit transactions are actually NOT smaller than non-segwit transactions. The only reason they are cheaper, is that they weigh less, relatively speaking. If the spammers were using Segwit, the fees would be the same as they are now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 11:14;0;0;2/ The second part to this, is that with any block size larger than 300k, the situation just gets worse and worse, even if users upgrade their phones regularly (and many do not). To maintain the status quo, block size would need to be 300k. :/;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 11:13;0;1;1/ The problem isn't in theory at this point, but in practice. While users *can* run a node on their phones, the cost to doing so (battery life, data usage, heat, or whatever) is higher than they're willing to sacrifice for security.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 11:11;0;0;"(I mean that in a good way; thanks!) Maybe put a draft in a Google Docs and share it with me? That way I can help/revise as needed, and then publish it on my own blog to get it visibility.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 11:09;0;0;Go for it;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 11:00;0;1;Certainly, that's how it's already done now in Bitcoin Core... (ever since 0.11.0 released in 2015);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 10:50;0;0;Remember nodes don't need to store any of the blockchain, just download and process it. Once that's done, the data can be discarded.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 10:50;0;0;"Prohibitively high fees: We're working on it User-dev toxicity: You're imagining it. Indefinite dependence on L2: Why is this a problem? It's like complaining about dependence on the blockchain! Also, Segwit isn't L2; it's L1, part of the blockchain.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 10:43;0;0;Most phones can handle much more than 2 GB, I think...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 10:30;0;0;Now you're just trolling.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 10:29;0;0;If they don't care, then why not run it? (Hint: answer almost always amounts to: blockchain size is too big!);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 10:18;0;0;Miners aren't making blocks that large yet (and a good thing, too, since they're harmful to Bitcoin!).https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/69i2md/observe_for_yourself_segwit_allows_2_mb_blocks_in/ …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 10:12;0;9;The sender can always malleate his own transaction, by changing the order of inputs, which inputs are used, how much fee is paid, etc. Segwit only stops random joes unrelated to the transaction from doing it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 10:11;1;15;It doesn't. It just makes it a bit more detectable, by making it harder to hide it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 10:10;0;0;3/ Developers have no power, and do not decide protocol changes anyway.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 10:10;0;0;2/ We just increased the block size to 2-4 MB. And that was without a reason to do so, and with it being hugely dangerous. It would be insane to do any further increases any time soon.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 10:10;0;0;1/ I am serious. Bitcoin is broken and insecure unless a majority of people are running their own nodes. It's not comparable to running a webserver at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 10:02;0;0;Doubt it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 10:02;0;22;Because it doesn't solve them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 10:02;0;0;"That's not true. There isn't 1 MB of real transactions per block. We're probably getting close, but we're not there yet. Furthermore, the limit isn't 1 MB anymore - it's already been increased to 4 MB, with a practical limit closer to 2-3 MB. Spam is unlimited;can't clear it all";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 09:59;0;7;You can still do intentional malleability even with Segwit.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 09:59;0;16;But you need more than just Segwit for that - you need Lightning also.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 09:54;69;360;Things Segwit solves: 1) Unintentional transaction ID malleability Things Segwit does not solve: 1) World hunger, 2) Social/economic class gaps, 3) Dishonest people, 4) Centralisation, 5) High fees, 6) Poverty, 7) Cancer, 8) Transaction sizes, ...... It's not magic, just tech.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 09:32;0;0;Most users don't run nodes right now. So 1 MB is already provably too big.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 09:32;0;0;Segwit doesn't reduce the size of any data...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 09:31;0;0;You sound in denial. The reality is that Bitcoin is being attacked, and while Bitcoin continues to work in this situation, it does get more expensive to use. Block size has nothing to do with it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 09:00;0;0;If everybody cannot ever run a full node, then Bitcoin has failed. Giving up on the problem doesn't solve it. Sync your phone's node over WiFi, or run your node at home.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 09:00;0;0;The spam floods...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 08:59;0;0;Fees have nothing to do with decentralisation...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 08:36;0;2;Without your own full node, you might as well be using PayPal. And without most people using full nodes, Bitcoin itself as a whole is insecure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 08:36;0;0;You're reading too much troll garbage. Sending transactions isn't attacking.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 08:24;0;1;And if you're doing business day-to-day, and your node dies, you need to close down for over a month??;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 08:23;0;1;It's reasonable for new users to have to wait 40 days until they can begin receiving bitcoins? Who wants to wait that long? Already, a few days is too long for most people.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 08:23;0;0;Not sure what your point is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 07:44;0;0;No idea.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 07:37;0;1;It already is, just not widely deployed/tested yet. @ TorGuard recently began accepting Lightning-enabled payments.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 07:28;0;1;BCash didn't decrease fees. It just isn't being attacked [as much] or used. Lightning will indeed decrease fees for real.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;17.01.2018 00:06;0;1;It's not enough to just download the most recent blocks as they come in. You first need to download the entire history since 2009.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 23:28;0;0;No, that's just an obvious assumption when mining is this centralised.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 23:27;0;0;No, node costs have increased since then. With 1 MB blocks, the costs continue to increase faster than the improvements in tech.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 23:23;0;0;False dilemma. There's no reason you'd lose hashrate by maintaining the same block reward. For most of Bitcoin's history, the block reward remained the same while hashrate increased.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 23:21;0;1;Nah, why bother? It's not important.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 23:20;0;0;Non-mining nodes contribute to the network's security by backing it financially. To pay these users/merchants, you need to pay valid bitcoins their full node accepts as confirmed. Malicious nodes would need to have customers. But at that point, they'd end up creating an altcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 23:19;0;2;It seems probable the miners are enabling them by refunding the fees.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 23:18;0;0;We just had a one-off increase, and it didn't. Nor is there any rational reason to expect it would.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 23:17;0;3;I'm not sure. 1-way-peg still has the problem of altcoins (someone is left holding worthless assets) if the sidechain doesn't survive long-term...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 23:15;0;1;Lightning;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 22:30;0;0;Nah. If someone simply wants to experiment, they should create a testnet and not allow real funds at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 22:28;0;0;Well, you're wrong...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 22:28;0;2;Note that Alice's node *IS* a full node...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 22:26;0;1;The most obvious thing you're missing is that new users require new nodes, not existing ones.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 22:25;0;0;Yes. But that distinction only matters when you get to fee levels ABOVE the spam. In this case, the infinite spam demand is at the fee levels we are currently observing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 22:23;0;3;"That whole paper seems to scream incompetence"".""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 22:22;0;1;No, there is no substantial benefit to handling incoming connections. What is important is that you use a full node. Whether it is listening or not is of no relevance.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 22:18;0;0;We haven't reached the first potential mass adoption phase. Bitcoin still has a long way to go before it's ready for that. Centralization of development has never been a real problem for Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 22:16;1;9;Block size increases don't reduce transaction fees.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 12:25;0;3;I don't understand the question.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 08:59;0;3;"Not if the infinite demand drops off when price increases, such that the demand is now finite. That's where transaction fees come in. ;)";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 06:16;0;0;Criminal prosecution is much more effective than DDoS protection, when you know the attacker.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 05:26;0;0;Prove it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 05:22;0;0;Well, right now if your wallet is lost / never comes back online, you lose the bitcoins. With Lightning, in theory there might be a way for your counterparties to help you recover your funds, but I don't think the standard supports that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 05:18;0;3;They sit there until your Lightning node comes back online. If your counterparty tries to rob you while you're offline, someone needs to broadcast a fraud proof to stop it, but that can be literally anyone (no trust needed).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 04:30;0;0;No, that's reality when you try to provide a service people have no limit to their potential use of, at far below actual cost.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 04:23;0;0;Not when demand is infinite.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 04:22;0;0;Hmm, send a transaction for $20 or open a channel for $30 and send transactions free from now on... tough choice. /s;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 03:59;0;0;No, there aren't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 03:58;0;0;That's just plain delusional.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 03:43;0;2;For federated sidechains, you don't need anything beyond multisig. For decentralised sidechains, segwit isn't particularly useful, and is also not enough - future softforks are needed still.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 03:41;0;0;This statement makes no sense. Lightning reduces fees, regardless of what the fees are.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 03:41;0;0;I haven't seen Coinbase or HitBTC do any BCH pumping.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 03:40;1;2;"No, just a few of the miners (there's only a few to begin with) need to collude. See 2X - that attack would have been successful if everyone was using SPV"". Full nodes other than your own basically don't matter.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 03:39;0;0;It helps ensure only full nodes are making transactions, for one thing. In other words, we should have as a goal, that running a full node is always cheaper than making transactions.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 03:37;0;8;It says a lot of things, which, if you actually look at the paper and apply critical thinking, are clearly bogus claims.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 02:56;1;5;There's no evidence to support that claim. But yes, the situation is indeed pretty bad, which is why we need smaller blocks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 02:55;0;0;They are secured on the block chain. Those open and close transactions use Bitcoin's smart contracting capabilities to guarantee the L2 transactions are secure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 02:54;0;0;Same thing. Most proof of work chain might have inflation, confiscation, etc.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 02:51;0;0;Capacity has nothing to do with it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 02:35;1;6;"Second layers are still transactions. If you like SPV"", then use PayPal. Basically the same thing.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 02:34;4;15;Bitcoin's security depends on a majority of the economy using their own full node. Without that, it's simply centralised and insecure. Datacentres are not useful, since they are run by a third-party.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 02:25;1;9;Most people with bitcoins today don't use their own full node, mostly because the blockchain is so large and takes too long to sync.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 02:25;0;3;It doesn't reduce size at all, only increases the block size limit.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 02:09;0;9;Nothing unclear about the blockchain... Considering even 1 MB blocks are causing substantial harm to Bitcoin, no further research is needed to know that 8 MB would be worse.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 02:08;0;2;Segwit does nothing to reduce fees. It only appears that way temporarily because Segwit txs use less weight than non-Segwit txs, so there's a RELATIVE difference in fee rate.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 02:01;0;0;Lightning is the next step to improve usability. That doesn't mean we shouldn't prosecute criminals disrupting it to the full extent of law in the meantime.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 02:00;0;0;Identifying spam and defining it are two different things. Identifying it is not necessary to hold a conversation about it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 01:58;1;8;Storage was never a concern. Bandwidth is one of them. Bandwidth does improve, but slower than the blockchain has grown.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 01:57;0;0;Transactions which don't have a purpose of transferring bitcoins from A to B.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 01:56;0;0;It completely ignored anything that matters.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 01:30;0;1;Totally irrelevant.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 01:28;0;0;BCH is not a decentralised network.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 01:28;2;7;It didn't say 4 MB was okay. It said >4 MB was undeniably harmful - it made no conclusions as to what size was actually safe. Price doesn't have any relevance to this. Bandwidth may have doubled, but the blockchain has much MORE than doubled in that time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 01:27;0;0;Right.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 01:27;0;0;Infrastructure can't even reasonable handle 1 MB yet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 01:26;0;3;No, most people *won't* touch it. As for the rest, you're full of crap.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 01:25;0;1;Increasing 1 MB to 2 MB merely doubles capacity. That's what linear means. Worse still: it has an exponential *cost*.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 01:04;0;4;Both claims are wrong. Tx volume isn't what sets fees. Spam does. If BCH were spammed as much as Bitcoin, fees would be IDENTICAL.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 00:56;0;1;I wouldn't call Coinbase an attack per se. More like a piano shop strapping (a lot of) foam to pianos and dropping them out a 10 story building to get them to ground level, while ignoring that there might be someone on the sidewalk below.

LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 00:48;2;7;8 MB is insane, period.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.01.2018 00:22;0;0;It's the wallet software that matters.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 23:56;0;2;It has improved constantly, year after year. The problem is that block size is too big, and grows faster than the improvements can keep up with. BCH has done NOTHING to improve scaling.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 23:14;0;9;I don't think I agree with the decision (but I also didn't look at your history), but it's within the realm of legitimate moderation and not a clear-cut case of censorship.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 12:18;0;1;We do have a fireplace, but unfortunately I didn't think to save wood from the tree Irma took out. :(;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 12:17;0;0;Lightning and MAST are huge leaps forward. By treating the blockchain as an (unbribable, uncorruptible) court system, and doing transactions truly peer-to-peer, instead of broadcasting them to the entire world.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 12:16;0;0;IRC;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:45;0;1;No. But there's no upper limit to outside temperature in order to cool inside. Once the heat pump cools to freezing outside, on the other hand, no more heat inside...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:37;0;1;It really isn't. Whether the Earth is flat or round has literally no relevance to how I live my life or my goals and duties.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:36;0;0;Catholicism is well-founded on rational facts. Maybe you want to take that back.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:35;0;0;You have to ignore a ton of evidence to claim there is no evidence...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:30;0;2;We just need to make it easier to pair your wallet (whichever it may be) with your node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:29;0;0;I am willing to make that assumption. They are the experts, and frankly, IT DOESN'T MATTER.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:28;0;0;You could circumnavigate, yes, but it would take a lot longer than just going over!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:25;0;0;The Bible speaks toward a spherical Earth, not a flat one. And the ENTIRE flat earth community is certainly quite small (probably mostly trolls who don't actually believe it).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:24;0;1;It could be, but it's a better approach to split up Bitcoin Core more, rather than try to shove additional stuff in. Split off the wallet, etc.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:21;0;2;Motionless, maybe, but that's a huge difference from flat. The firmament was presumably a water canopy, prior to the Flood. Many other planets have water canopys we can observe.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:20;0;0;Whether the plane keeps going or not, sats. couldn't pass from one part to the other unless they were going around...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:15;0;1;How are you going to run the nodes, if they require more resources than you have, and take weeks to sync?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:14;0;4;No, the burden is on the one making the accusation, so you. I'm not a reddit admin, so obviously I can't look at reddit admin stuff.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:13;0;3;3) Even the Bible (the 100% inerrant word of God) refers to the Earth as a globe, not a plane.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:10;0;3;So all this, and you can't even give me a specific example to look at?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:10;0;0;My wife would veto it anyway. She's a health nut.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:07;0;4;Flat Earth is so obviously wrong that it doesn't take research to be certain it's nonsense...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:06;0;0;Over my head to set that up. I've been delaying getting a swimming pool heater, in hopes someone makes one out of miners...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:05;0;3;Blackarrow and KnCMiner's were somewhat quiet, IIRC.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 09:05;0;12;I have looked into many cases of alleged censorship, and not one of them has turned out to be true.

LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 08:48;0;0;That's just trolling. He stopped working on Bitcoin long before BCH was even envisioned.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 08:45;0;0;I'm not sure why.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 08:44;0;7;Sounds like BIP 152, which has been supported by Bitcoin Core and Knots for quite some time now...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 08:43;0;5;"Bitcoin can compete with USD; but its competitive advantages don't lie in economic activity.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 08:42;0;0;He stopped contributing on his own.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 08:41;0;0;Lightning, MAST, and aggregated signatures.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 08:31;0;5;Economic activity and greed works fine with USD and such already. You don't need Bitcoin for that. Core has no power... and even if we did, it's better if people *don't* use Segwit until they're ready to upgrade to Lightning.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 08:24;0;0;(and if they don't do it the way their customers want, a competitors will step in and fill the demand.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 08:23;0;1;L2 might threaten their business models, but to remain in business, companies need to serve customers. If nobody wants their services, they just die.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 08:23;0;2;Segwit by itself isn't useful to implement. IMO companies choosing not to support it are doing good on that issue. But it doesn't add technical debt either...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 08:22;0;10;If Lightning fails to gain adoption, then that indicates nobody actually minds the fees. Companies that rely on subsidies may end up going out of business when those subsidies dry up. There's no free lunch.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 08:21;0;0;Denying the problem exist doesn't solve anything either. The original solution included miners filtering out the spam, but they dropped the ball on that (and it become impossible to detect anyway). Better, architectural solutions are being developed now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 08:19;0;0;Nobody was booted.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 08:08;0;8;Lightning is a p2p network that uses the blockchain. It isn't between companies (although they can of course use it too)...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 08:02;0;0;You won't even know which is the unchanged protocol unless you run a node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 08:01;0;0;Legitimate transactions are ones which are intended to move bitcoins from A to B, and have no data beyond what that entails. Spam are ones with other purposes that Bitcoin was never intended for.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:59;0;7;If you don't verify the whole thing, how do you know it's a valid block? If you verify the parts only that someone else claims is bad, how do you stop him from forcing you to download all the parts? If you need to download it all, but don't have resources for it, what then?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:55;0;0;But the more developers you take away from working on actually known solutions, the longer it will take before we have those...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:53;0;0;Sure, go for it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:50;0;0;Can only solve problems one at a time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:49;0;6;1) If legitimate transactions were exceeding 1 MB, then we'd see use cases drop off, and fees come back down. 2) Spam used to be identifiable. There is no reason to assume it stopped.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:47;0;17;Even if Blockstream had control of Bitcoin (it doesn't), BCH wouldn't have solved that because BCH is not Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:42;0;0;Yes, and then the only way to bring the cost of real transactions down, is to make them more efficient. That's what Lightning, MAST, and signature aggregation do.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:38;0;0;You don't need authority to state facts in English.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:36;0;4;Obviously you don't know what you're talking about.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:35;0;7;I learned.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:35;0;18;Step 2 is to make the real transactions cheaper by reducing their relative data usage. Lightning does this. MAST does this. Signature aggregation does this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:34;0;6;I didn't know you were also a troll?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:32;0;0;Now this is just delusional. Do you think spam email doesn't exist, because emails are legitimate if they get past your filter???;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:29;0;9;Entirely possible. I didn't mean to imply BCH is behind the attacks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:27;0;3;It's pretty much impractical these days.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:25;0;0;The only way to get your non-spam transaction through now, is to outbid it in fees. And there you have why fees are high...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:24;0;19;Spam transactions. If it wasn't being attacked, we'd still have fee-less transactions getting confirmed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:21;0;0;What makes you think your coins exist on their fork? Or that their fork is going to be worth anything?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:21;0;8;If we knew that, maybe we could petition their local government to prosecute.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:20;0;3;Miners don't verify blocks anymore (at least not before building on top). And miners have proven to be willing to unethically collaborate on such attacks (see 2X). The only thing holding it back is whether they can succeed or not - and that's when the economy is important.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:19;0;1;"Transmitting a new block is about 256 bytes these days, regardless of the block size. Furthermore, almost all miners today use centralised backbones and skip the verification before they start building on top. So there is pretty much zero orphan"" block risk regardless of size.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:15;0;0;I'm not actually sure what the latest status of using zk-SNARKs like this is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:15;0;1;There are only two ways known to do that: 1) Verify the entire history yourself. This is what Bitcoin does. 2) Prove that the entire history was verified leading to that UTXO set. You would need to run the entire blockchain validation in a zk-SNARK.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:13;0;30;Why do you assume the second layer adopted will be one Blockstream can profit from? Lightning is much cheaper.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:12;0;1;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=23768.msg3815348#msg3815348 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:12;0;14;Not even that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:11;0;11;Sure, miners can reject low-fee transactions, but the demand is still there at $0. If BCH is spammed like Bitcoin, logically fees will end up being approximately the same range.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:09;3;7;Litecoin is nothing but a scam. It's not even worth talking about. (BCH is worth talking about, although I don't support it per se.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:06;0;2;How do you figure the DAA works better? Seems to be generally accepted that their changes were a total failure... Signatures were just copied from Bitcoin/Segwit. Fees are lower only because nobody is attacking them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:05;0;17;Much less.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:04;0;24;That plan doesn't make too much sense to me, in light of Lightning. I suppose they can offer features not available in Bitcoin (yet), but block size doesn't come into that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 07:00;0;0;(To not keep the entire history, just enable pruning. It just doesn't solve the issues.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 06:59;0;1;You don't need to *keep* the entire history. But unless you process and validate it, you *don't know* the UTXO set. Without knowing the UTXO set, you can't validate new blocks. Without validating new blocks, you can't validate new transactions.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 06:58;0;42;Because you're a troll. Anyone who has actually used reddit knows it isn't censored.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 06:56;0;26;No, it isn't significantly more costly, because the difference between a penny and two pennies is negligible.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 06:55;1;15;Eventually, but probably not for a decade or two. (But if the network can one day do so without harming decentralisation, we can do it sooner.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 06:54;0;11;It doesn't solve anything. The only reason they're cheaper/faster is because BCH isn't attacked as much as Bitcoin. Put the same level of attack on BCH and it will fail worse.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 06:54;1;4;It's been under attack for years now. If it wasn't, we'd still have free transactions.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 06:53;0;21;And what's the incentive for monetised second layers, with a fast, cheap, decentralised, p2p, trustless second layer?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 06:52;0;19;Transactions are cheap to generate.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 06:51;0;3;Lightning is a decentralised, p2p, trustless, and permissionless protocol...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 06:50;0;19;Demand is literally infinite once you get spammers. Block sizes don't matter at that point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 06:50;0;8;"I'm a moral person and therefore don't perform attacks (and the BCH community probably wouldn't all consent to it). It's not a solution at all, and it will destroy BCH long-term. It's well on the way there, even - BCH supporters already publicly say don't run a node""!""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 06:48;0;6;"Imagine if loading this Twitter page were 1.2 MB *more* for each user who views it. So the first person gets 1.2 MB, then the second has to load 2.4 MB; the third, 3.6 MB; and so on. You can't compare a CHANGE with a FIXED SIZE. They're just not the same at all.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 06:47;2;8;Because you fail to understand the issues. Bitcoin isn't merely downloading a block every few minutes. New users need to download the ENTIRE HISTORY BACK TO 2009. That size is currently 150 GB and keeps growing faster than improvements to bandwidth and processing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 06:46;0;10;No more difficult than monetising smaller blocks...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 06:23;0;50;I encourage BCH to experiment in their own direction, but so far they've only regressed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 06:21;0;9;Where did you get the idea that Bitcoin isn't? Sure, mining centralisation sucks, but Lightning will return p2p even despite that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 06:18;447;1644;Reminder: BCH doesn't solve anything. The only reason it has cheaper fees is because it's not being attacked as much as Bitcoin. Nobody likes high fees, but BCH is a step in the wrong direction to actually fixing the problems causing them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.01.2018 00:53;0;0;"The CPAs seem to all disagree; the cost basis transfers with it, at least if there's a gain.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 22:58;0;0;Not seriously. More of an idle curiosity, since nobody has donated 14000 BTC to me. :p;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 22:51;0;0;Yes, of course, I need to do that anyway since cap. gains still applies to gifts.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 22:42;0;1;"Well, that FAQ seems to answer whether the gifts can be considered self employment income: since they don't nearly cover the value of the work I do on Bitcoin, obviously full consideration is not received in return.""""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 22:34;0;0;Whoa, that's actually even more complicated. I didn't realise FMV was used for calculating a loss. This sounds super-gameable...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 22:29;0;1;It would really suck if people were paying cap. gains on what they donated to me, and then I paid cap. gains again for the same thing. :(;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 22:28;0;0;Apparently not under US or UK law. The cost basis is simply transferred with the property.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 22:25;0;0;(And if so, how does that work if the recipient is assuming a cost basis of $0 because he can't identify the donators?);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 22:25;0;0;Wouldn't the limit apply to the cost basis of the donate bitcoins? So you could gift even 14000 BTC today tax-free, so long as you acquired them at a cost basis of under $1?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 22:24;0;2;Yes, but the capital gains isn't exempt, only the gift itself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 12:13;0;1;To be fair, it does seem that having insurance will be the most cost-effective way of handling pregnancies, so I did keep it this year anyway.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 12:07;0;1;It's not mandatory anymore. :);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 12:03;0;0;Not that I am aware of. Health insurance might get taken out before taxes, so that's something I guess?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 11:49;0;0;But the conditions haven't changed either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 11:43;0;0;I think in the US, you need to have children (and also be poor) to be entirely exempt from income tax. But in the US, they also take it out of employees paychecks upfront, so poor people don't necessarily need to file taxes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 11:08;0;0;Dunno, I find it pretty awful still. I wish I could just get an invoice from the IRS for the amount owed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 05:57;0;1;P.S. Miners get transaction fees, not developers.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 05:56;0;2;"1) Because block size increases are harmful and stupid; 2) developers don't decide protocol changes, and there is no consensus for this one; 3) Segwit did increase the block size as recently as a few months ago";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 03:53;0;4;A professional just confirmed my understanding:https://twitter.com/EvanFox22/status/952370107841425408 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 03:45;0;4;That's backward. If it was mined when bitcoins were worthless, the cost basis is zero, and therefore I owe capital gains on the full amount...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 03:44;0;0;How would it be zero?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 03:42;0;0;Yeah, that's wrong... but while they confuse Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin, it doesn't change the reality that Bitcoin Core is still a thing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 03:13;0;2;Bitcoin is the system and currency. Bitcoin Core is an implementation of Bitcoin. They're both two different, but related, things. Bitcoin Knots, btcd, libbitcoin, etc are also implementations of Bitcoin, just like Bitcoin Core.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 03:10;0;1;If I were a charity, the donation would be tax-deductible. It isn't. But the person donating still doesn't need to pay capital gains tax on the donated bitcoins. The recipient inherits that liability in the form of having to use the donator's cost basis. (AIUI / IANACPA);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 02:10;0;0;As long as I could.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 02:09;0;2;Any info I can forward to her?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 02:09;0;0;If you bought it for $15k, and I spent/sell it at $15k, my liability is zero. (But please be honest if you do tell me your cost basis.) AFAIK there's no real tax benefit for capital losses (but maybe they can cancel out capital gains elsewhere? I'm not sure).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 02:06;0;0;And the gain is calculated based on the cost basis, which is conveyed as-is along with the donated bitcoins.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 01:07;0;2;I'm no tax expert, but AFAIK that's only required for donators to take a deduction. The gift itself is still tax-free either way.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 01:00;0;0;Why?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 00:56;0;0;Not for gifts/donations.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 00:56;0;2;The same does not apply to Bitcoin, because bitcoins rationally have a long-term inherent value.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 00:55;0;0;Why would it be regular income?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 00:49;0;1;Not according to my CPA... :/;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;14.01.2018 00:48;0;2;All I know is that taxes are morally obligatory and that I'd prefer to minimise them when legally possible. It would be nice if the tax code was simpler, too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.01.2018 23:58;0;0;My CPA did not give me the impression I have a choice in this matter. It sounds like donators aren't *supposed* to pay capital gains on donations.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.01.2018 23:51;0;2;I don't have to pay taxes on the gift, but I do on the capital gains when I spend it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.01.2018 23:51;1;3;As I understand it, if you donated 1 BTC that cost you $700, and I sell/spend that 1 BTC at $15k, I need to pay capital gains tax on $15k minus $700 = $14300. If I don't know your cost basis, I have to pay capital gains on the entire $15k.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.01.2018 23:47;0;13;Dash has nothing to do with me.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.01.2018 03:43;0;0;Obviously not, considering the ongoing spam that's pushing up Bitcoin fees.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.01.2018 03:41;0;3;Hmm, I guess in such a scenario, it's using the data for operations, so breaks that idea. Oh well, even if it only is effective on UTXOs in the end, it's still worth doing.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.01.2018 00:03;0;1;Making spendable spam requires more bytes, and therefore is more expensive.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.01.2018 00:02;1;2;At least one author disagrees, so it would need a new BIP:https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/628 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.01.2018 23:53;0;3;BTW, you seem to focus a lot on UTXO set size, but that's not the only/primary need for P2SH^2. It's also helpful to reduce spam from bloating up the blockchain. It's not a perfect solution - indeed, it can't eliminate *all* spam.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.01.2018 23:52;0;1;Spam in general sets the fee floor. Perhaps not all spam today can be prevented with P2SH^2, but it's a step in the right direction.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.01.2018 23:48;0;5;Not once legacy is disabled. And little evidence spam is a problem? Why do you think fees are so high???;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.01.2018 23:39;0;1;That makes no sense. The only premises here are objective facts.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.01.2018 23:38;0;3;Implementation doesn't equate to usage. It wouldn't be hard for Electrum and Trezor to add support for an upgraded Bech32.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.01.2018 23:35;0;0;What is that supposed to mean?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.01.2018 23:30;0;13;Maybe a new BIP deprecating the current one would work out okay. There's not *that* much real-world Bech32 adoption yet.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.01.2018 01:15;0;0;The Church can study doctrine and formally define clarifications on the details, but the doctrine itself doesn't change, and clarifications obviously never contradict what is already known.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.01.2018 01:09;0;0;No... The Church considers biological evolution to be a possible hypothesis (ie, it's not heresy), but has no position on whether it is correct or not. When it comes to doctrine, any change is absolutely impossible and to say it is possible is condemned.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;1.01.2018 22:39;0;0;The real Catholic Church is the one established and led by Jesus, for the purpose of promulgating His doctrine.

LukeDashjr;29.12.2017 10:03;0;0;No, old nodes will accept <=300k blocks as valid.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.12.2017 09:20;0;2;No such variable exists, but what you probably mean would indeed be a softfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.12.2017 06:40;0;1;BIP149 was not at all safer. It was far worse.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.12.2017 06:15;0;1;Source code files, IIRC;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.12.2017 05:57;0;1;"Now I'm not going to say there weren't exceptions to this, but those who supported Segwit, and opposed BIP148 of their own decision-making (ie, not simply deferring to whatever Core does"") were a very small group.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.12.2017 05:54;0;2;Also, of the users polled, not only did a majority support BIP148, but those who did not also either opposed Segwit in general, or said they would support BIP148 if Core released it in an official release.

LukeDashjr;29.12.2017 05:39;0;2;The split (caused by malicious miners), not BIP148, would have pushed them to enforce. The same is true even without any softfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.12.2017 05:38;0;1;Every single measurable metric showed majority support for BIP148. Even if you want to claim that's imperfect, it's still the best we have, and there is no reason to assume it was wrong.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 23:25;0;3;No, I mean the completely insecure unconfirmed transactions that show up immediately.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 23:03;0;5;The security of sidechains is the same as that of centralised altcoins where only miners run full nodes. In other words, far less than the security of decentralised cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin aspires to be.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 22:55;0;8;Sidechains have drastically reduced security from the main chain, especially with current levels of miner centralisation. People will still argue over the main chain block size.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 22:52;0;3;It won't make transactions any more instant than Bitcoin already has (ie, not secure).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 22:44;2;18;This is too vague for me to get any meaning out of. Sidechains aren't particularly useful for scaling, mainly for developer experimentation. Lightning, on the other hand, actually improves scaling by magnitudes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 22:42;0;6;I wouldn't put it past him. Yet we still continue to progress.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 22:38;1;7;What? Lightning is far better than sidechains for doing what it does. Sidechains are mainly useful for developers, not users.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 22:17;0;0;Not really.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 21:48;0;1;"Segwit could be done without a hardfork (and quite obviously IMO, not aha!""), but that's not ""any protocol changes"".""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 21:47;0;0;100% is very obviously much more decentralised than 0.4%.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 21:38;0;0;Softforks are backward compatible so long as miners are not performing attacks. It's a good attribute to have, but not relevant to the question at hand, where the miners are in fact attacking. During such circumstances, ex-full nodes are simply insecure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 21:34;0;1;That's irrelevant, unless you are opposed to new people adopting Bitcoin, and want everyone who isn't already running a full node to leave.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 21:33;0;0;You missed the point. So long as those running full node decreases less than those not running full nodes, the net result is actually an improvement to Bitcoin's decentralisation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 21:20;0;1;That initial sync in fact continues to grow indefinitely in time since the blockchain grows faster than improvement in processing blocks! (Tech improvements would break-even with ~300k/block average.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 21:19;0;1;Today, the biggest problem is simply that they are choosing not to use full nodes, and the reason almost always comes down to the long time to perform the initial synchronisation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 21:18;0;0;It's not the node count that matters, but the percentage of bitcoin economic activity using nodes. If people don't use bitcoins, it's not harmful to Bitcoin that they don't run a node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 21:17;0;0;Inaction is indeed often invalid. Otherwise Bitcoin has no rules at all, since light wallets are in a perpetual state of accepting invalid blocks. Otherwise softforks never succeed, since very rarely do 100% of nodes upgrade before activation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 21:15;0;4;Such a thing would be an attack even if it had 99% support and 100% hashrate. There is no comparison.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 21:01;0;0;No, and I strongly disagree with that idea.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 21:00;0;2;You believe he's correct because you don't understand the issues involved. Storage was NEVER a concern.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 20:58;0;0;Not increasing Bitcoin's centralisation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 20:57;0;0;Just because you decide to follow an invalid chain doesn't make it any less invalid. It's no different than if you decided to run 2X.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 12:00;0;1;But the split wouldn't have been caused by BIP148.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 11:01;1;20;You mean it'd prove you wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 08:03;0;0;?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 06:22;1;7;It's a trade-off. Decide for yourself which is more important to you: lower fees, or Bitcoin's health/decentralisation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 06:06;1;5;Unless you need the malleability fix, using it is harmful to Bitcoin because it enables larger blocks.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;28.12.2017 05:55;0;8;No, BIP148 could not have caused a split. Any split would have come from malicious miners intentionally doing itt, and they can do it with or without any softfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.12.2017 19:44;0;0;Bitcoin Knots already supports this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.12.2017 09:37;0;1;Unsurprisingly, you don't understand how Bitcoin works at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.12.2017 08:48;0;2;That's sidechains, not Lightning...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;27.12.2017 05:12;0;0;Well, there are at least 3 independent Lightning implementations (so far), all with separate developer teams...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.12.2017 03:13;1;0;Sure, you can change the consensus rules using a bdb config file in the bitcoin datadir. That doesn't make it any less a hardfork, however.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.12.2017 03:12;0;0;No, because BIP 8 is lacking mandatory signalling. Without that, it is unclear when or even if the softfork has become active.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.12.2017 01:59;1;4;You're wrong. It absolutely was a hardfork. Full nodes prior to 0.8.0 will reject blocks that the current Bitcoin rules accept.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.12.2017 01:55;0;4;Softforks should be similar to BIP 148. Miners aren't relevant to hardforks, so there's no point in miner signalling there. Once consensus is reached, just pick a date for activation.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.12.2017 04:48;0;0;Mining is only a small part of the overall picture. They merely order transactions. Enforcing the rules (including the 21MBTC limit, no inflation, etc) is done by the economy. But for that to work, the economy needs to at least in a majority of cases be using full nodes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.12.2017 04:46;0;1;It's not just about miners. The biggest problem is people using the currency (bitcoins), but not using the consensus system (Bitcoin).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.12.2017 04:46;0;0;Not really a valid comparison. Bitcoin means everyone processes everything on the blockchain. It's not dividing up the effort - it's duplicating it many times over.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.12.2017 04:44;0;0;P2P is cheaper *for the uploader*, because the downloaders are providing capacity as well. But in terms of *total* resource costs, direct download from a datacentre would indeed be cheaper. (And MUCH cheaper if it can multicast...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.12.2017 03:36;1;4;BIPs aren't necessarily exclusive either. There can be many layer 2s with BIPs.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.12.2017 03:35;0;5;Yes, they fit perfectly with BIPs. BIPs aren't merely the consensus protocol (most of them aren't, in fact) but cover any aspect of Bitcoin that requires standardization / coordination between different implementations.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.12.2017 02:46;0;0;Crypto doesn't eliminate the necessity for that, sorry. Centralised systems are inherently cheaper than decentralised ones.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.12.2017 01:20;0;4;Altcoins borrow other BIPs all the time too. That's nothing new.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.12.2017 00:42;0;3;Because BIPs is the standardization process for Bitcoin...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.12.2017 00:25;0;5;Regardless, there is no need to create division in the standards process.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 19:57;0;0;No, tx size gets smaller means lower fees per tx...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 19:56;0;2;Majority needs to run a node for Bitcoin to work. If even Silicon Valley can't run one, that just proves the point. Datacentres are useless for running a node, since they're under someone else's control.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 19:55;1;0;Full nodes are how you use Bitcoin. If you can't afford that, then either don't use Bitcoin, or work to make full nodes cheaper (eg, reducing the block size). No internet? Fine, don't use Bitcoin. No water? Okay, you have bigger priorities than this, and shouldn't worry about it;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 19:53;0;1;I personally have no transfer limit (besides what is practically possible with 5 Mbps, for the moment). 1 TB is apparently the limit in Silicon Valley...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 19:51;0;20;Blocksat is a nice way to save bandwidth/money, but it is at the end of the day centralised, so it should not be relied on exclusively. It's okay for a niche who have nothing better to depend on blocksat alone, but the majority need to at least be capable of operating without it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 19:49;0;0;There's no comparison.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 19:47;0;0;Current bandwidth requirement is 150 GB for initial sync + 9-14 GB per month. If your node is using 1.5 TB/mo after the initial sync, and you don't want it to, you simply need to configure it for your preferred usage.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 19:43;0;0;Nodes don't have to be on 24/7, just when you're receiving.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 19:43;0;0;You have it backward.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 19:42;0;0;That's where the 1 TB cap comes in...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 19:11;0;0;But Bitcoin only works securely if at least MOST people run their own node. That's a constraint Bitcoin scaling NEEDS to work within.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 19:03;0;0;No reason why it can't replace fiat. But you're bringing up irrelevant problems. Bitcoin doesn't solve everything.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 19:02;0;5;That's not useful. We're talking about your node, which shouldn't be entrusted to the care of a datacentre.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 19:02;0;0;"You asked for an example, so I gave a perfect example. Don't oh pleeez"" me...""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 19:01;0;0;If you spend your entire salary as soon as you receive it, it doesn't matter what currency you use. No reason to use Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 18:31;0;0;FUD. And even if it were to become true, so what? A week is nothing when you can just use the channel for years.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 18:30;0;8;Maybe they can't. Pretending we have solutions to problems when we really don't isn't an answer.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 18:28;0;1;Not without reducing security.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 18:28;0;0;"2X is exactly the example of a potential successful attack against SPV"" wallets.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 18:27;0;0;It's not typically useful to have more than one full node per person. Remember, they only matter to the extent that you use them for your wallet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 16:02;5;47;After all these years, you STILL don't get it?? Storage was NEVER a concern.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 16:00;0;0;Except 2X is strictly *worse*.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 16:00;0;0;Those are a bunch of false assertions that show a complete lack of understanding for how Bitcoin works.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 15:59;0;0;Your problem is that you are ignorant of the fact that Bitcoin is just another Fed or PayPal without decentralisation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 15:57;0;0;Sure, that's fine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 15:56;0;9;You don't have any arguments. Yes, it's just FUD.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 15:55;0;0;Your claims are simply not true.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 15:53;0;0;Blocks haven't been that big for those 5 years. It's only recently they've been reaching 1+ MB.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 15:52;0;0;If it breaks a drive, the drive was already defective.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 15:51;0;0;Betrayer? Not at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 15:49;0;0;Nodes mostly only matter if they're being used to verify transactions received by the node operator.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 15:48;0;8;Because 1) it's needed for Lightning, and 2) miners had no business blocking what the community wanted.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 09:23;0;1;Eh, I go right to left along the top, then left to right on the 2nd row, and so on...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 09:13;0;2;Less than 85% could result in uncertainty with regard to the outcome of invalid blocks being mined, especially with the fluctuating disparity of economic activity across nodes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 09:06;0;1;200k nodes is enough if there are only 235k bitcoin owners...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 09:03;0;5;Hard to tell exactly. We're around ~150k full nodes, and probably much more than 200k bitcoin owners, so the situation is pretty bad. :/;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 09:02;0;1;1) The maximum time everyday users are willing to wait to begin using Bitcoin. 2) Probably not for Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 09:01;0;1;That's one possible option. Maybe NFC pairing or something to make it super-simple.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 08:56;0;0;No, they're not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 08:55;0;1;Increasing block size doesn't lower fees, merely harms Bitcoin's decentralisation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 08:55;3;19;Node decentralisation: A minimum of at least 85% of economic activity using bitcoins should have the receiving end using their very own full node to verify the payment has confirmed. Mining decentralisation: No more than 10% controlled by a single entity, and 30% within a nation;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 08:43;0;1;Not if technology improves faster than the blockchain grows.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 08:42;1;0;Merchants can use PayPal if they want something centralised. No reason to turn Bitcoin into PayPal.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 08:41;0;2;"Nobody is trying to attack"" is no substitute for real security.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 08:34;0;4;Because POS is broken garbage that isn't secure in practice.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 08:24;1;4;Dunno about zcash, but you can already run a full node on Android devices:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greenaddress.abcore …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 08:11;0;3;Its functionality depends on its decentralisation. Otherwise, you'd be better off with PayPal.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 08:10;0;0;With sufficiently smaller blocks, technology could improve at a faster pace than the blockchain grows.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 08:09;0;1;It would require a rather complicated softfork that nobody's managed to get reasonably performant yet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 08:08;0;1;Sure, just use Bitcoin Knots or Core for your wallet. Simple, easy, and just works. (If you need it to use less than 200 GB of disk space, pick Knots and enable pruning when you set it up.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 08:07;0;0;So you're afraid that someone might compromise your security, and therefore to avoid that, you choose to not have any security???;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 08:06;0;3;"That's 18 months better than what we have if we do nothing. ;)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 08:04;0;0;Just the smart contracts for everyone, that secure the behind-the-scenes transaction volume invisible to you.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 08:03;0;1;It's also not secure. Consensus rules are only rules if they're enforced. But trusting it means you're not enforcing it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 05:24;0;1;What makes you think it's detectable?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 05:12;0;1;That's pretty much already the case with Bitcoin mining today though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 05:09;0;0;Wouldn't that also put any small miner out of operation since he can't finance the runtime until a return is made?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 05:05;0;0;But that doesn't hold up. Early on, one of the iterations of Eligius had insanely bad luck for quite a long time, but at the end of the day, it didn't matter.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 04:58;0;11;Anything can be artificially made cheap when nobody cares to use it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 04:57;0;1;Does it work when you assume the users in question are willing to blindly trust the host to handle everything including funds (as is typically already the case with pooled and hosted mining today)?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 04:54;1;0;"No, because if you can't pool mine, those people will just resort to hosted mining instead. And hosted mining is much worse. (Pooling isn't actually a problem in the first place; merely the current implementation of it is.)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 04:51;0;0;That specific proposal wouldn't work at all: verification would be too expensive to even consider it a PoW algorithm. (And although the general idea might be useful, it wouldn't incentivise full nodes.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 04:50;1;10;While I do think better node diversity would be a good thing, I consider it much less of an issue than the fact that too many people aren't running full nodes at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 04:48;0;0;That only stops pools, not hosted mining.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 04:48;0;1;The only way to prove that, is to sync from genesis up to that height.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 04:45;0;0;The topic is itself a waste of time, so why should I need to argue it?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 04:41;0;5;If you want more, find them yourself...https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/48bq35/increase_default_block_max_size_to_1mb/d0j8txc/ …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 04:34;0;4;No such thing exists...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 04:34;0;2;You're wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 04:26;0;0;Not without a reduction of security. And the network's overall security depends on the collective security of its users...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 04:26;0;1;No. Nodes are mostly only useful if the person who runs the node uses it for his wallet. Multiple nodes per person generally is a waste (although one at home + one at work or similar can make sense).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 04:16;0;0;The current block size limit is 6-9 *times* a maximum safe size. Even the 1 MB block size is 3 times. The math isn't linear, so if we hold it long enough, we'll eventually hit a cross-over point, but it's kinda scary to look at the numbers for how bad it will get first.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 04:13;0;1;Reducing the limit, maybe not. But reducing the actual sizes of blocks, certainly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 04:13;0;1;Everyone who expects to receive bitcoins should be running his own full node. It doesn't need to be 24/7. It doesn't need to be listening/public. Pruning is fine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 04:11;0;1;Not sure what you're asking. VPS are of little value for a full node, since the VPS is under someone else's control.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 04:11;0;2;Keep in mind that once we get past the critical danger, the people who need to start nodes are the ones just *beginning* to use Bitcoin, and have no bitcoins or profit therefrom.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:42;1;6;Lightning;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:42;0;3;How do you know the storage is in fact secure?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:38;0;1;No...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:37;0;1;Depends on the infrastructure being used for the transfer. And even the traditional banks often have a per-transaction fee on top of the percentage. Note that Lightning will be closed to traditional bank transfer fees, in terms of a fixed cost plus a percent.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:35;0;0;What do you mean? Lightning inherently aggregates itself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:34;0;33;Because he's an idiot and wasting my time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:33;0;4;Nodes always need to sync full history. But that only requires big servers store it for downloading from. Since the nodes verify it themselves, no need to concern over security of the storage itself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:30;0;1;"We shouldn't, at least long-term. All smart contracts can be abbreviated as <long list of conditions> OR <both parties agree>"". Lightning can handle at least the latter case. So the blockchain basically becomes a court system for resolving disputes/fraud.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:28;0;26;No, you don't. Go read the whitepaper and the Bitcoin v0.1 source code.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:27;0;1;Because storage was never a problem in the first place?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:27;0;0;No, but each transaction depends on the validity and monitoring of the smart contracts on the blockchain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:26;0;11;"Worse still, even if you can somehow prove all invalid blocks, it's still not enough; because an attacker can make valid blocks, but withhold a single transaction to prevent full nodes from accepting them. So we'd also need proof of most-nodes-don't-know-it"".""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:24;6;25;The idea for SPV security was that full nodes would generate and broadcast fraud proofs, so that SPV nodes could know which blocks are invalid and therefore to be ignored regardless of PoW. The problem is, invalid blocks can be malformed such that they can't be proven invalid.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:23;0;0;I don't know. Hopefully soon.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:22;2;4;"Storage was never a bottleneck in the first place, since you can just enable pruning. When it comes to CPU time and bandwidth, the blockchain size growth (ie, block size; ~70%/year) is significantly outpacing improvements (which are only 17%/year historically).";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:20;0;6;Nothing is fully centralisation-proof, but Lightning is centralisation-resistant more than the current network is. People keeping bitcoins on exchanges is ALREADY a problem.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:19;0;31;You don't understand Bitcoin at all...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:18;0;0;You are wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:16;0;0;I hope it's eventually completely invisible to the end user.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:16;0;10;I think at least in theory, multisig ought to be possible, but I'm not sure if the Lightning standards support it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:13;0;8;TBD. I'm not defeatist, though, just realist. I can support a PoW change, while still admitting that we don't have consensus for it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:12;0;5;Technology historically improves at a rate of about 17% per year, so if the blockchain grows slower than that, there is a chance of improvement to the net time/cost required.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:11;0;0;That reduces your security to trusting whoever did the pre-loading.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:10;0;0;Verifying the blockchain is part of verifying the actual (Lightning) transactions.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:06;0;2;Free markets actually favour centralisation...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:06;0;2;"There's over 150000 nodes right now, and for Bitcoin to be secure, most people receiving bitcoins need to be running their own; so MANY more are required. If 10 million people are using bitcoins, then we should have at least 8 million people using Bitcoin (running full nodes)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:02;0;0;Using Segwit enables larger blocks, which is harmful.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:02;0;0;Lightning is centralisation-resistant. Decreasing the block size can reduce or even reverse the ever-growing sync time required to start a full node (ie, to start using Bitcoin for real).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 03:01;2;33;You realize that's pure FUD? We don't even get the fees! And Blockstream doesn't own or profit from LN either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 02:59;0;0;Without decentralisation, you lose those too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 02:04;1;4;Using Segwit enables larger blocks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 02:04;0;2;Pretty much. Lightning is just another layer of Bitcoin, after all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 02:03;0;0;Think of the on-chain fees as a subscription fee. It's still much less than if we tried to push everything on-chain. A block size decrease won't likely increase fees much, especially if Lightning is in production first.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 02:02;0;1;Defeats the purpose, since such a node is based on trusted state, not secure.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 00:54;0;5;... 1/100th of the cost isn't good enough because it's non-zero? Think about what you're saying.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 00:46;1;16;It's not the number of nodes, but percentage of all usage, that matters. Right now, it's dangerously low.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 00:43;13;75;It's not detectable if you run a full node. But it's already incentivised: you get to use a secure decentralised currency. Without your own full node, you're just trusting someone else at random as if they were PayPal.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 00:42;3;34;Segwit does not decrease the size of transactions. That's a myth. Lightning is the method of reducing block sizes (and also fees) that I had in mind.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 00:41;0;0;The easiest way is to simply install Bitcoin Knots or Core, and use the built-in wallet to receive your bitcoin payments. (There are ways to use other wallets as well, but I'm not sure if there are any simple guides for setting that up.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 00:39;1;0;Less space used for your transactions = less fees, even if fee/byte gets high.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 00:36;5;29;Reducing the block size will thankfully reduce transaction fees too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 00:33;0;3;Are you using it to confirm that your wallet is receiving bitcoins?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 00:32;1;14;Bitcoin has never had an unlimited block size. Satoshi's plan for that was true SPV, but true SPV turned out to be impossible.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 00:30;4;63;Reducing the block size is a pretty important part. Backward syncing would probably be helpful. Making it easier for users to run mobile wallets using their full node at home. Education of users in general.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 00:29;4;30;There are dangerously few full nodes (probably a minority of the economic activity using their own), mining relies on a centralised (and censorable) backbone, majority hashrate is in a single nation's jurisdiction, etc.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.12.2017 00:26;173;691;We don't need to *preserve* Bitcoin's decentralization. It's already lost. What we need is to *restore* that decentralisation we've lost, before it's too late and gone forever.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.12.2017 20:53;0;0;Nothing is more important than decentralisation, because without decentralisation, we have nothing better than the Fed or PayPal.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.12.2017 20:24;0;0;It's more important that we keep it usable for people. And with even 1 MB blocks, many people are finding the sync time way too long.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.12.2017 20:05;1;1;Suffering? Larger blocks is suffering. Smaller is good. I (and others) intentionally don't use Segwit specifically to avoid larger blocks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.12.2017 19:59;0;16;Bitcoin already allows 2 MB blocks, so that's not an increase at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.12.2017 19:34;0;0;Not sure what you're talking about?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.12.2017 19:32;0;0;Do you know if this was before or after the eucharistic miracle in his presence?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.12.2017 16:47;0;0;I don't get it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.12.2017 06:27;0;8;A bit was first 1/8th of a US dollar. $125k / 1000000 = $0.125 = 1 USD bit.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.12.2017 06:26;1;6;Bitcoin simply isn't ready for mainstream yet. It's an unfortunately reality. Before we get to that point, it needs to be simple and obvious to everyone that they need to run a full node (maybe they won't know that's what they're doing).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.12.2017 05:26;0;3;Without a full node, you are not secure, and you contribute to the network as a whole being insecure. You need a Bitcoin full node to be secure using Lightning as well.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.12.2017 05:14;0;19;At $125k/BTC, we'll have bits parity... 1 USD bit = 1 Bitcoin bit.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.12.2017 00:49;0;0;That needs to change if we want Bitcoin to become secure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.12.2017 00:38;0;2;Bitcoin only works at all if most people use a full node of their own. Without that, it's worse than PayPal.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.12.2017 00:37;0;0;Except I really wasn't wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 23:20;0;0;The block size limit is a limit, not a deterrent. 1 MB was quite successfully limiting spam until the block size was increased.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 23:20;0;0;No. 4-8 MB blocks would be absolutely insane. Even 1 MB blocks are doing a ton of damage, and we haven't even seen just how bad 2 MB (the current effective limit) will be.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 23:01;0;0;Indeed. If centralisation gets any worse, Bitcoin becomes no different from the Fed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 22:44;0;0;At this point, identifying spam is more effort than it's worth (since the spam can just change again to hide). Why do you think we need something more concrete?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 22:43;0;0;I'm not a security expert, but if you were concerned with that aspect, I'd offline the system entirely. Maybe there's benefits to the middle-ground, though - I'm not sure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 22:42;0;2;Increasing the block size would almost certainly kill Bitcoin/cryptocurrency permanently. I'm not fighting with the BCH guys. They're free to pursue their own path.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 21:42;0;0;Yes, quite positive. Even if we had reached 1 MB of legit transactions, the rising fees would have outpriced the low-value transfers and moved them off-chain, reducing legitimate load below 1 MB again.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 21:40;0;0;Sure, just setup the firewall to only allow port 8333. (Whether this is useful or not, I am less sure of.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 20:30;0;0;"Not significantly, from the block size increase. If Mr. Spammer stopped spamming at the same time because he wants to prove a point"", it might - but that's another matter.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 20:29;0;0;Yes, the Windows side can access the Linux partition since it has complete control of the machine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 10:05;0;0;You’re the one being disingenuous.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 09:57;0;0;Fees are set by what spammers are willing to pay. It has little to do with block size.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 09:42;0;0;Might as well just set the block size to 5 MB. (Miners can choose their own median fee at will.) Anyhow, you didn't read my tweet. Increasing block size won't lower fees.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 09:35;0;0;Not a big problem, and one that can probably only be solved by altruistic miners enabling sweeping into Lightning channels.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 09:34;0;0;Block size and fee aren't closely related. If spammers will pay 999 sat/B, then 1000 sat/B is necessarily the outcome. Increasing block size won't change that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 07:44;0;1;Nodes don't need to run 24/7, just when you receive a transaction.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 07:02;0;1;It seems to me that it would use less time to run Bitcoin Knots on your PC, than to plug in and setup dedicated hardware for the node...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 06:58;0;2;Running Bitcoin Knots or Bitcoin Core is indeed a full node by itself. The only thing left is to be sure you're using it for your own wallet. What do you mean by time constraint?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 06:52;0;1;Best is to maintain the node yourself, including verifying and installing the node software. The most important part is to use it for your own wallet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 05:48;0;4;Loss of nodes would be terrible, but we need to GAIN nodes. And the cost to starting a new node is higher than maintaining an existing one...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.12.2017 05:46;0;2;This isn't an inherent limitation, but I think you are correct that current light wallets don't handle this case cleanly.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 19:44;0;4;I already explained it. If you don't get it, then at the very least stop spreading misinformation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 19:36;0;3;So long as there is demand (users), there will always be a supplier (miners). Anyone can mine.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 19:35;0;0;A lower fee than the spam floor won't get confirmed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 19:35;0;0;Well, it's pretty obvious when a large chunk of the community opposes a proposal, that it doesn't have consensus.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 19:18;0;5;No, the blockchain merely prevents double spending. The economy / p2p network enforcing the validity rules on blocks they receive is a large part of what makes Bitcoin secure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 19:10;0;0;And as soon as malicious miners realise their efforts to centralise are fruitless, they are strongly incentivised (by their losses) not to try it again.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 19:09;0;0;"Yes, but every time"" is unlikely to be much more often than once a year.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 19:09;0;1;Even if we can identify it today, improving on the spam filters further is likely to see it become eventually impossible.

LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 19:07;0;0;Yes. But without consensus, it isn't possible.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 19:07;0;3;You don't know what you're talking about.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 19:06;0;1;People are always incentivised to use centralized services, simply because they are more efficient and inherently cheaper. Bitcoin can't change that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 19:04;0;2;Can't prove that's unspendable. Send them to OP_RETURN.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 19:03;0;1;So that you can use Bitcoin for large transactions, obviously.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 19:01;0;2;Not in the same way. In a zero-sum game, selling actually takes away from someone else.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 18:59;0;2;Internet only improves at a rate slower than 1 MB/10 minutes... And just because you have 1 Gb/s at home doesn't mean everyone else does. Many people are stuck with DSL.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 18:57;0;0;The current miner centralisation circumstances, for example.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 10:02;0;0;Not possible, since miners can always divert the fees. (eg, require transactions to have zero real fee, and an extra OP_TRUE output with the fee.);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 09:56;0;0;Nah, this is a scenario where you want a PoW change hardfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 09:56;0;2;It's not mere nodes that matters, but the economy behind those nodes. If you control most of the Bitcoin economy, sure, you can probably make sure that miners follow you.. Segwit was deployed via the BIP148 UASF. The NYA was just an excuse miners made up to go along with it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 09:45;0;2;Bitcoin spam is like email spam: always an arms race. As detection improves, so will evasion. Any criteria set for identifying spam today will be obsolete tomorrow (not literal days).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 09:44;0;0;If the miners all leave, just get new miners.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 09:41;0;3;Nobody? I do. I'm sure many others do as well.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 09:38;6;29;Note that even if there was a real conflict of interest in holding litecoins (which I have serious doubts about), the clean way to exit would be to sell only enough to cover value put in (ie, what he bought them for originally) and then BURN the rest.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 09:35;0;0;You can't. Even if you find a way to identify current spam, knowledge of that identification method would enable the miner to avoid detection of his spam.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 09:35;0;0;Depends on whether the community also rejects that block. If so, then the miners are forming their own altcoin with different rules. If not, then you are forming your own altcoin with different rules.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 08:50;0;1;"So long as you include blocks full of nothing but spam as empty blocks"", nobody can ever prevent empty blocks.

LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 08:07;0;1;No.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 07:23;0;1;At the current rate of things, it will be too late by then.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 07:23;0;6;Anyone can mine. If the current miners go away, someone else will replace them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 06:39;0;6;You don't have to be mining to reject invalid blocks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 06:39;0;1;General purpose CPUs are a bit easier to detect being backdoored, at least.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 05:53;0;0;Open sourced ASICs aren't possible in general, AIUI, due to ASIC design necessarily using non-free primitives.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 05:35;0;0;No, it would just limit the bottleneck to CPU and I/O time instead of bandwidth. Right now, they're both pretty close (depending on your hardware and ISP).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 03:23;0;7;Wrong. Light wallets cannot verify ANYTHING.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 03:08;0;7;Wrong. The network's security is derived from the economy as a whole being secure and enforcing the rules. So while your node only secures yourself, that makes up a small part of the economy, which combined is what secures the network.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 02:08;0;0;"But how do you know if the full nodes have rejected a block or not? ;)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 02:00;0;0;I'm not sure what you're asking. I wouldn't advise keeping a wallet on a phone period. Run the wallet at home too, and access it remotely from a phone if you want.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 01:59;0;0;You don't need to store it. Just enable pruning.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.12.2017 01:58;0;0;Might as well just run Windows... Your weakest link sets the effective security level. You could put Windows in a VM perhaps.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 22:09;0;1;It's actually harder if you make it impractical to do the real sync. You can read code diffs, but you can't verify the hash unless you run the entire sync.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 20:53;0;5;Denial that spam is a real thing and a problem, is what is ludicrous. Fees are only $44 *because* of spam. (Disclaimer: Did not personally verify $44 claim);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 20:51;0;1;Unless you look back that far, you can't know the current UTXO set. Without that, you can't move forward at all either. (And that's ignoring the security assumption that an invalid chain will be rejected.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 20:50;0;1;And when miners commit bogus hashes? To actually be useful, you need to punish that by having full nodes reject the block as invalid... which means they need to verify it for every block as a consensus rule.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 20:48;0;3;The trade-off to pruning, is that you can't restore old wallet backups.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 20:48;0;3;Every *user* (not just miners) needs to sync the entire blockchain, because that is how Bitcoin is secured in the first place.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 20:46;0;2;We don't have committed UTXO sets, and efforts to accomplish it have proven fruitless so far. It's also a significant change to the security model.

LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 20:42;0;2;Enable pruning and you're fine with 10 GB.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 20:41;0;7;It's less about what is fair, and more about what is technically viable. At the end of the day, it will cost whatever is needed to outbid the equivalent spam.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 20:38;0;0;I never advocated for fees to be in thousands of dollars...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 20:38;0;0;Because that's what the Litecoin pumpers were falsely claiming it could do better.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 20:11;0;0;Nope. 1. Just because Litecoin doesn't scale any better than Bitcoin, doesn't mean it is identical to Bitcoin. 2. The way BCH is better than LTC is not related to its scaling capabilities, but merely because it is slightly less scammy, and has a unique direction of its own.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 20:08;0;0;The only concern with block size, is that it's currently too big. There is literally no reason to ever prefer larger blocks, when you can do the same things with smaller ones.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 20:07;0;13;You should expect fees for a decentralised system to always be higher than that for a centralised system. Maybe Bitcoin can do better long-term with technology like Lightning due to regulation overhead of centralised systems, but that is TBD.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 19:14;0;1;Note that Linux support is not 100% or OOTB.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 19:13;0;1;"Which doesn't say litecoin and bitcoin are not suited for low value payments and that bch is preferable.""""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 18:10;0;0;Nope. I didn't say that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 18:10;0;0;Not all of us, no. I sure wasn't raised with that idea.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 18:05;1;1;No, even when I used a N900, I ran Gentoo on it. Nowadays, I use a GPD Win (again, running Gentoo).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 07:02;0;1;Except that's not what matters. Validation does, and very few ETH nodes actually do full validation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 06:27;0;0;Depends on the person in question's bandwidth, CPU, disk, etc.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 05:48;0;1;Indeed, spam is what sets the fee floor, no matter what block sizes are. Long-term, the only way to combat spam is to reduce the data requirements for legitimate Bitcoin usage. Lightning is a big step forward here.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 05:46;0;0;I did. https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/kycpoll/answers.php#fullnode …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 05:45;0;1;Full nodes don't need to be kept up.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 05:45;0;1;No, I didn't say that at all. What I said was, BTC >>>>>>>> BCH > LTC;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 05:41;0;0;The blockchain size is pretty closely related to the cryptographic verification complexity.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.12.2017 01:32;0;0;Most video games don't *process* anywhere near 150 GB before you begin playing... much less cryptographically verify it all. I imagine such games are probably delivered on some kind of optical medium as well, rather than downloaded - 150 GB is over 3 hours even with 100 Mbps!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 22:45;3;8;Hard to predict the outcome of a given size. I would suggest we drop to 300k for maybe a month (temporary), and study the results. Likely this will work out better if we have Lightning in production first...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 22:34;0;0;No, the problem is that Joe Random User isn't running his own full node. In most cases, because the resource cost is too high for the initial sync.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 22:17;0;2;That's why we need block sizes to be smaller.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 21:19;0;0;To do this, we need at least a significant supermajority of users to support it. Until then, nobody (not even supporters) should run code enforcing it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 21:14;0;0;With 1 MB blocks, the blockchain would grow by over 52 GB every year. Already, the blockchain at ~150 GB is too much, such that many people don't run a full node at all. Bitcoin's security model depends on MOST economic activity using full nodes under the recipient's own control;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 19:01;0;0;I didn't mention efficiency...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 18:26;0;1;(Note that a blockchain explorer may very well have reason to manage their mempool differently from a reasonable user.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 18:24;0;1;Whatever is needed for an anonymous miner to be present among the p2p node network (exclusively) without taking on an unsustainable increase of stale blocks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 18:09;1;14;"(Actually, I phrased this poorly. Today's network nodes can obviously handle 1 MB; the problem with 1 MB is all the economic activity that isn't using their own nodes. But there's certainly no evidence to suggest today's network nodes can handle 8 MB.)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 18:06;0;0;I'm not aware of any religion teaching that...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 18:03;0;1;Spam, and http://blockchain.info not managing their mempool as a reasonable user ought.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 18:01;0;0;The USA does not have any State favoured churches.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 18:00;0;0;That ignores and makes worse the even bigger problem: that the network has too few nodes (in percentage of economic activity).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 17:25;1;5;There is no pain from block sizes. Just from miners and spammers.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 17:25;5;18;Your premise is false. Today's network nodes can't even handle 1 MB. We should be *reducing* the block size limit, if anything.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 17:23;0;1;I have never attended State-operated schools, for starters... When do you think they would have such an opportunity?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 17:22;0;0;What the taxation is used to pay for is irrelevant.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 17:22;0;2;You sound blind.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 07:03;0;1;You're not making any sense now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 06:19;0;0;No, Bitmain was actually pretty late to the space.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 04:45;0;0;You missed the point. It's not about who was first, but who has made it infeasible for others to do it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 04:05;0;0;There's nothing to read there, just youtube links and unfounded assertions. Besides, I never said we need taxes for nurses/police.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 01:10;0;1;Still completely relevant today. Litecoin doesn't even do what you're claiming.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 00:44;0;2;No, there isn't a reasonable purpose for that. They could just as well issue the shares via a centralised ledger, at much better efficiency and featureset.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.12.2017 00:43;0;0;You may be unable to tell if you have been conditioned, but you *can* tell if a particular entity has had the *opportunity* to do so.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2017 06:37;0;0;Bitcoin is both.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2017 04:39;0;0;"He wasn't having a civil debate; he was lying and trolling.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2017 04:37;0;1;I just gave you the reason: because dumping them is unethical.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2017 04:36;0;0;No, Bitcoin implemented it first. Litecoin merely used it first. Usage is nothing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2017 04:35;0;0;Litecoin never had any credibility in the first place. There is nothing new here - been pointing this out since 2011.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2017 04:34;0;2;"Bitcoin has had smart contracts since 2009. What do you mean by the buzzword enterprise support""? EEA just sounds like a scammy version of Scaling Bitcoin & similar conferences...""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2017 01:40;0;1;Shoo, liar troll;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.12.2017 00:00;0;4;Decentralised systems have a very high cost compared to well-designed centralised systems. The balking is at using code designed for decentralised systems, and hijacking it for centralised ones - that's totally inefficient.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 23:56;0;1;The reduction in scenario 1 is temporary, as the unprofitable miners will no doubt be selling their hardware to someone with better electric rates.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 23:48;0;4;Bitcoin created all that innovation and technology...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 23:47;0;1;There are two scenarios: 1. Fees drop slightly. Only a minority of miners become unprofitable. This may reduce security temporarily, but at the end of the day, isn't really a problem. 2. Fees drop substantially. No miners are profitable. So they simply set fee req. higher.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 23:44;0;3;Merely using something first doesn't mean you made it or did anything particularly special.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 23:43;0;0;You missed my point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 23:35;0;2;That's okay, since every gain you make with Litecoin is someone else's loss on Litecoin. (Which is why I consider it unethical to dump my largeish stash of litecoins.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 23:34;0;2;That's only if the income drops slightly, which wouldn't be a problem. If the income drops substantially, ALL miners will be unprofitable without higher fees. No need for cooperation at that point, just setting fee rates they can afford to accept.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 23:26;0;2;Miners ultimately control the fees needed to get confirmed. If the fees are too low, miners can simply require higher.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 23:17;0;4;What L2 solutions do you have in mind? Note that Lightning requires the blockchain...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:50;0;1;You're welcome to read my many other tweets as well if you want.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:45;0;2;LOL? It DOESN'T do what is claimed! That's not an opinion, it's a fact.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:40;0;1;Litecoin promotion is full of deceptive and outright false marketing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:38;0;2;I don't take the *most* issue with Litecoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:36;0;2;Honeypots only do that when the attacker doesn't know it's a honeypot...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:34;0;1;Testnet is sufficient. No excuse to scam people in the name of testing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:31;0;0;You don't need to count objects to know that 1+1=2;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:30;0;2;What matters is that nobody can stop anyone else from using it. Litecoin isn't needed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:28;0;0;The public does the deployment, but at least in this context, merely deploying the code does nothing to assure or improve security of the code.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:26;0;1;Segwit was already certain before 2X was ever a thing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:23;0;2;Of course I can. Security is something derived from code and review, not from deployment.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:22;0;1;There has been nothing new with Litecoin since it launched.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:22;0;2;Everything you have said there is false.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:17;2;15;No, we got Segwit on Bitcoin because the community decided to upgrade to Segwit using a UASF to bypass malicious miners. It had nothing to do with Litecoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:17;0;3;Scams such as Litecoin should have no value whatsoever. So they are always *over*valued when they are given any value at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:16;2;3;But it does. Without long-term adoption / value, cryptocurrencies are zero-sum games and function as scams redistributing money from one set of people to another.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:14;0;1;There may be a few altcoins with some valuable contribution. Whether or not those are sufficient for long-term survival, however, I have my doubts. And without long-term adoption, the altcoin itself still functions as a scam despite even good intentions.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:09;0;1;That's not a fact. Not even close.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:06;0;1;So now you're going from lying to blatant trolling... That's typically about the point where I block people.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 22:04;0;2;Activation is nothing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:59;0;0;No. Litecoin is a scam, nothing more. It doesn't help Bitcoin in any way, only hurts it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:58;0;0;Even if I did, this isn't about me. You're still completely wrong, as a matter of objective fact.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:51;0;0;Which is complete nonsense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:48;0;1;Litecoin has never done anything for Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:48;0;0;You don't know what you're talking about then.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:45;0;3;Bitcoin implemented them first.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:43;0;0;Being respectful doesn't justify lying.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:35;0;0;No.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:31;1;12;It's a lie to claim Bitcoin has followed in Litecoin's footsteps. Segwit etc are Bitcoin inventions, not Litecoin's. Litecoin merely copied them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:31;0;1;I refuse to agree to disagree. You are simply wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:30;0;0;Copying someone else's work doesn't mean they are affiliated with you.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:30;0;0;No, it is simply FACT to say that. Coloured coins were invented for Bitcoin, BTW.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:14;0;1;That *minority of* the market will get burned eventually.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:13;0;1;"What do you mean work with""? Bitcoin has nothing to do with Litecoin.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:10;0;2;They have done literally nothing useful.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:10;0;1;No, it doesn't exclude anything. There is no use case or viability for Litecoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:09;0;1;There is zero innovation in Litecoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:07;0;4;"What new things"" do you think Ethereum brought to the table? Everything I've heard them pump with, are things Bitcoin has always had.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:04;0;4;It still holds true today. Litecoin has made ZERO progress.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:03;0;0;Testnet is the testnet coin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:03;0;0;When these scams burn people, it will make Bitcoin look bad. Calling it out in advance is a way to minimise that damage.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:02;0;0;No.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 21:02;0;0;You're omitting some pretty important context...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 06:23;0;0;It hasn't been that much more profitable long enough yet. It takes time to produce and put new miners online.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 02:15;0;1;LOL, no. It's been an issue since 2011.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 02:15;0;4;No, Christianity/Catholicism remains the same as it was when Jesus established it in AD 33.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 01:49;0;1;Islam is not true, and hasn't survived. Today's Islam has required significant change since the time of Mohammad. It also contradicts itself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 01:48;1;0;You don't know what you're talking about. Bitcoin has supported smart contracts since its original launch in 2009!;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 01:45;1;1;What Coinbase does for fees has nothing to do with Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;17.12.2017 01:44;0;2;It should be possible for someone to decap a random POWER9 and verify there isn't any secret second CPU in them. As for the rest, the firmware/microcode is open source...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.12.2017 18:36;0;1;AFAIK the rest of the firmware (and CPU microcode) is all open source (but I don't know the exact licensing terms - it may be non-free/libre).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.12.2017 18:36;0;1;Depends on if you want a SAS/SATA controller onboard (optional). As I understand it, there are currently no open source options for that. Worse still, the optionally-onboard Microsemi controller requires non-free software to configure more complicated settings.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;10.12.2017 23:49;0;0;It doesn't combat the spam at all. It enables it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.12.2017 19:38;1;3;Depends on the degree of dislike, and who is in that group. If 75% of miners and the FIBRE operator are compelled by court order, they can pretty effectively prevent your money from ever being spent.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;10.12.2017 18:58;0;0;What?? Not nearly! Bitcoin is trivially censorable today.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;9.12.2017 04:38;0;1;It's not that they're non-ideal, but that they're abusing the system for data it was never intended to carry in the first place.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;8.12.2017 04:08;0;0;These things only protect your private keys. Without a secure full node, you can't be sure you *have* any bitcoins in the first place.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.12.2017 23:53;0;0;Bitcoin security REQUIRES the majority to run full nodes. Without that, it just doesn't work period. If that means no mass adoption, then we'll have to accept that. Or we can just continue to make full nodes mass adoption friendly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.12.2017 23:52;0;0;Completely false.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.12.2017 23:52;0;3;No, it isn't at all like saying that. Saying people shouldn't run a full node, is like saying they should all use a webwallet - because that's pretty much about the same security light wallets have.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.12.2017 23:27;0;2;It's not even an OS...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.12.2017 23:25;0;0;Security updates are different from normal updates. They're also much easier to review.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.12.2017 23:24;1;4;So solve them, instead of pretending they don't exist.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.12.2017 23:23;0;1;Standard Linux has zero isolation between applications. ANY of them can steal your funds. Qubes at least limits the amount of exposure you have - that's good for normies.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.12.2017 23:22;0;5;Neither of those are the purpose of full nodes. It is full nodes that define and enforce the rules miners must follow, and the users of these nodes which give a market value to those rules.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;7.12.2017 15:14;1;1;No, but your full node also needs to be secure to confirm you actually receive bitcoins.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.12.2017 15:13;1;1;There is research into neutralising ME for Intel CPUs. Personally, I plan to upgrade to a POWER9 Talos system for security-sensitive stuff.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;7.12.2017 15:11;1;4;HW wallets are only half the picture. You need your full node to be secure also.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.12.2017 15:11;0;3;Probably more than most people do - and I only ever install things I have compiled myself. But even without reading the code yourself, manual updates allow you to wait a few days for others to audit / notice issues (presumably on less-sensitive machines).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.12.2017 15:09;0;3;Linux with manual upgrades. Ideally audited before installing, but you could probably get most of the safety from delaying updates a few days in ordinary cases (assuming someone will raise a ruckus if there's a backdoor added).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.12.2017 15:08;0;1;Should be. Best if it's dedicated to your node/wallet and doesn't run other stuff. Ideal if you audit upgrades.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.12.2017 15:07;0;0;Does Qubes support Talos? :);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.12.2017 06:18;89;293;Reminder: If your OS is closed source or has automatic upgrades, it has backdoors. Not the best system to entrust the security of your full node and/or wallet.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.12.2017 13:48;0;2;IMO it would be best to consult with our community members with ASIC production experience, to see which algorithms are best for ASICs. If any existing chips support an alternative-SHA2-variant, that is probably a good option to consider. ASIC resistance is a negative property.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.12.2017 13:36;0;0;There are no viable alternatives to PoW itself. There are plenty of perfectly fine alternative PoW algorithms.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.12.2017 22:40;0;0;You don't know how Bitcoin works. That doesn't make *me* an idiot.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.12.2017 05:55;0;0;No, not assuming any of that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.12.2017 05:34;0;1;In this scenario, ideally we would change PoW algorithm to (CompanyY's alternative algorithm OR CompanyZ's alternative algorithm);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.12.2017 05:33;0;0;Consider the scenario with multiple manufacturers: CompanyX, CompanyY, and CompanyZ. CompanyX abuses their position to gain a monopoly (or at least an unsafe percentage) over mining. CompanyY and CompanyZ and honest.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.12.2017 00:05;0;1;It's a risk easily mitigated: just make your chips capable of two algorithm variants. Then if we need to change, if your chips are widespread and not monopolised, we can switch to the 2nd algo.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.12.2017 23:56;0;1;Misbehave is controlling too much. That's been well known since the whitepaper in 2009.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;4.12.2017 05:41;0;0;In this hypothetical case, the manufs would be choosing the new algo, and the community would approve it on the basis of wide distribution of their hardware and lack of abuse.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;4.12.2017 03:47;1;1;It's pretty trivial to modify SHA2 to be incompatible with normal SHA2. All they need to do is add an extra gate that can be toggled to change modes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.12.2017 03:46;0;0;There's no reason ASIC producers can't make their chips capable of SHA2 plus some incompatible SHA2 variant that the community can support in the event of a PoW change. In fact, ASIC manufacturers have been advised to do just that since 2012.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.12.2017 22:42;0;0;That doesn't make sense. The most permanent rules possible *already* include the 21M and 4M block weight limit. You can't get any stronger than these.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.12.2017 22:41;0;2;That ends the moment we change PoW. Then double spending will become impractical again.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.12.2017 22:39;1;1;It seems pretty unlikely we'll get to a PoW change in the near future, thanks to FUD. But honest manufacturers can help long-term by building their chips with an unpublished SHA2 variant alternate mode.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 20:05;0;0;You're the one with logic flaws.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 20:04;0;0;They're the ones who changed/deviated. Demand they rebrand.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 20:04;0;0;God likes ceremony and established His Church with a structure for some reason. Who are we to say He is wrong in doing so?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 20:03;0;0;"Because he wasn't Catholic. if ever…it shall appear that…even the Roman Pontiff,…has deviated from the Faith or fallen into heresy: the promotion or elevation, even if it was uncontested and by the unanimous assent of all the Cardinals, shall be null,void&worthless""""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 20:00;0;0;I'm not personally clear on how the vacancy can/should be filled. I presume that's a matter for the bishops to sort out, not mere laymen such as myself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 19:59;0;0;Okay, I'll never mind you.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 19:58;0;0;God decides what authority He gives, and the Church (led by God Himself) describes/defines infallibly what authority God has given. To an extent, human reason can figure out how to apply these principles.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 19:57;0;0;So you pay 4% of your income in taxes, in order to subsidize the health care for the poor. If people had provided enough charity to the poor voluntarily, maybe the State wouldn't have needed to do that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 19:55;0;0;Whether something is obligatory, neutral, or forbidden, is an independent matter from whether it is consensual or not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 19:52;0;1;The Catholic Church did nothing with JP2 except declare him a heretic (Bishop Thuc in 1982).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 19:48;0;1;You're delusional if you deny that God is very real.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 19:47;0;0;That doesn't change the fact that it's a) nonsense and b) has nothing to do with Blockstream.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 19:45;0;1;You're then trusting whoever coded in the premine for that block.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 19:45;0;0;There hasn't been a legitimate pope since 1958. The office has been vacant the entire time. JP2 was not an eligible candidate to become pope, under Catholic doctrine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 19:43;0;0;Who?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 19:43;0;0;I was particularly thinking of States which have instituted socialised healthcare.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 19:42;0;0;No, they aren't, unless you have the very mistaken notion that you *must* resist any obligation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 19:41;0;1;The Catholic Church is guaranteed, not any random fraud pretending to be the Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 19:41;0;0;He isn't and never was a head of the Catholic Church. He was strictly nothing but a fraud, according to Catholic doctrine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 19:41;0;0;Not really. The only reason we ignore Hitler's command to murder us is because he never had *that* authority, and also because it contradicts *his* superior's commands.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 17:53;0;2;No. I'm simply refuting an invalid argument. A fraud has no authority to represent or apologise for the Catholic Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 17:52;0;4;Yes, I don't disagree many States today take too much in taxes. But at the same time, we deserve at least some of it by embracing capitalism and failing to be sufficiently charitable on our own. If the poor of society were taken care of, the government wouldn't need to step in.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 17:50;0;0;Free will does not equate to free action. God restricts our actions in many ways, including through the State's just laws.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 17:50;0;0;Enemies to the evil first amendment, maybe, but not to the form of government itself. It is for this reason that at least Florida's Constitution denies Catholics the privilege of voting.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 17:48;0;1;Now you're just trolling.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 17:46;0;3;No, that's reality. It has nothing to do with Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 17:45;0;0;Evidence and logic is clear that God exists and authority only comes from Him.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 17:44;0;1;Except when they overstep their legitimate authority, yes. If Hitler says you must sit on a jury to judge a murderer, do so willingly. If he says you must *become* a murderer, that isn't something he has authority to order.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 17:42;0;0;Maybe he is. Maybe he isn't. But Gavin wasn't kicked out. He chose to stop contributing of his of volition.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 17:41;0;1;More or less. Bitcoin's security depends on a supermajority of the economic activity actually using full nodes operated by the recipient of the transaction. So long as block sizes are too big, it gets harder and harder. 300k is the break-even block size where technology keeps up.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 17:39;1;1;The State has never had the opportunity to condition me.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 17:38;0;0;Not exactly. Mortal sins are damning, *especially* for clergy. But a few bad apple clergy doesn't negate the infallibility of the Church's teachings.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 17:37;0;0;Why not? Why would anyone ever use it if it's a black box with who-knows-what backdoors or exploits?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 17:36;0;0;4 MB is block size. Weight isn't bytes. It's true that practically, a sane block won't exceed maybe 3 MB or so, but that's beside the point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 17:35;0;0;So don't make a giant mempool. This isn't rocket science.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 17:35;0;1;JP2 was not Catholic, nor was his sect.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 07:14;0;2;If the Church can err in its official teachings, then that and that alone would make it a lie.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 07:13;0;0;Yet that's not what Jesus guaranteed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 06:54;0;0;There are no real benefits of using it, and plenty of harmful effects.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 06:53;0;0;You've never done anything you knew was wrong? Or made a mistake that you should have known better?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 06:53;0;0;I already told you where He made the guarantee. In the middle-east. I've also already told you how we can know for certain He made the guarantee: lack of any other alternative legacy. Only TEACHING the opposite of what Jesus taught would be a failure. He only guaranteed that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 06:47;0;0;Are we hitting a language barrier, or are you trolling me? Nobody suggested switching in minutes...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 06:47;0;1;Sounds like you should look into history. Jesus established a hierarchical Church, not merely left disciples to fend for themselves. Evil actions have nothing to do with teachings.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 06:43;0;0;Such evil unfortunately always occurs in any sizable organization where humans work with children.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 06:42;0;1;His entire teaching ministry took place in the middle-east. But more importantly, the Church was the *only* legacy He left us for learning His doctrine. Writings came later on, from that Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 06:34;0;2;God didn't leave us a book. He left us a Church that He guaranteed would uphold and teach His doctrine without err.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 06:30;0;2;"You missed the point. Avoid using Segwit"" has as little to do with business, as it does with your random altcoin.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 06:28;0;1;But God is sufficient and more certain than such arguments.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 06:28;0;1;"God's representative is the Church, and we all possess intimate"" knowledge of God from His public revelation to the Apostles.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 06:09;0;2;This has nothing to do about biz. Are you just mad I didn't support your altcoin? :/;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 06:08;0;3;Not really. If we're willing to trust miners, we might as well just use a centralised currency. The whole point of decentralisation is to allow us to distrust them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 05:37;0;3;If everybody of economic significance runs a full node, you don't have a small percent of the economy running nodes...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 05:35;0;0;This is necessary even for the network/node decentralisation, a completely different issue from miner centralisation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 05:11;0;8;Because the major miner(s) have chosen to act maliciously. It's not a matter of mere portrayal, but accurately describing the actions they have chosen to take.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 05:10;0;2;There is no perfect size at the moment. A trade-off needs to be made. 700k would probably retain most legitimate usage. 300k would break-even on harm. Once we have Lightning, we could perhaps *expand* use cases while also dropping to <100k.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 05:09;0;0;If the economy is using light wallets, they have no way to even detect that the miners' chain isn't following the rules.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 05:08;0;3;More FUD. Blockstream has no influence/involvement in Bitcoin Core's development. They just pay some people to work on it. And where's the results of your claimed crowdfunding effort? I don't see it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 05:06;0;0;That's just FUD. Everyone who has made a sincere effort to contribute has been welcomed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 05:06;0;0;All authority comes from God, including the general authority given to all States.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 04:02;0;0;Yes, He did and still does. He Himself is the Source of the State's authority.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 03:59;0;6;Maybe you should help out. There's only so much our limited development capacity can do in the time given. Bitcoin is still a very new technology, and these goals will take real work to accomplish.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 03:57;0;1;"Pilate therefore saith to him: Speakest thou not to me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and I have power to release thee?"" Jesus answered: ""Thou shouldst not have any power against me, unless it were given thee from above.""""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 03:55;1;10;"There is no team"", just a bunch of people working on the same Bitcoin project. Nobody can speak for anyone else. I fully expect Bitcoin to be used for coffee when complete.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 03:53;0;1;You are completely wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 03:50;0;1;Finally, mining has centralised to the point that only a few people control more than a majority of the total mining. Any honest miners are in such a minority that they would certainly not be able to maintain a longer chain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 03:49;0;2;And if the economy accepts the invalid block, that just means it wasn't really invalid, and the hard fork to change that rule has succeeded. Why would the honest miners continue on the chain that doesn't pay them?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 03:48;0;1;How do you figure? There is no way for the full nodes to alert the rest of the users in a timely manner. They might not even notice themselves until much later, after the economy has moved on significantly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 02:43;0;2;Logic. Think about the scenario when miners violate the protocol rules, and the possible outcomes given different ratios of full node usage. For example, if 90% of the economy is using light wallets, and miners claim 1 satoshi more per year than the protocol allows, what happens?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 02:42;0;3;Nobody is trying to change Bitcoin into something else.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 02:34;0;1;No write-up that I am aware of.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 02:34;0;3;Using Segwit enables miners to make blocks larger, which is harmful to Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 02:33;1;1;You're reading too much into this. Segwit is good. The problem is the block size bundled with it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 02:29;0;0;That's a lie though;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 02:24;0;3;Full nodes are around 150k these days. Unless there's under 200k bitcoin users (unlikely), that's very dangerous.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 02:23;0;1;Of course not;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 01:55;0;3;I am not a statist, liar. Nor have I hijacked anything.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 01:49;0;2;"1) You're changing the topic. There is no reason to assume people from 2009 still support the original idea as-is and without upgrades. 2) Segwit is simply a bugfix to Bitcoin; it doesn't change anything about the original idea. 3) The block size limit is 4 MB now, not 1 MB.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 01:38;0;0;I am not a Statist. Why are you slandering me?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 01:38;0;2;Prove it. (Hint: Roger and his cronies didn't show up until much later.) Besides, what gives them any more say over the direction of Bitcoin than anyone else who adopted Bitcoin after 2009?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 01:36;0;2;On principle. The community wanted Segwit. Miners had no business trying to prevent it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 01:36;0;2;No, that isn't what I claimed. And it is a block size increase - one that should be avoided as long as possible.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 01:35;0;0;The government's authority comes from God.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 01:28;0;5;Since this is a security product, I would assume the firmware source code available for audit and customisation? Please confirm where I can find it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 01:06;0;0;Nobody said that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 01:05;0;0;Please stick to ... whatever it is you do.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 01:05;0;0;No, we agreed it was an acceptable compromise to allow the limit to be increased as Segwit was adopted. Specifically (at least in my case), because Segwit enables Lightning to reduce the actual block size needed. There was not general agreement it should happen before Lightning.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 01:04;0;2;The whole point of avoiding using Segwit is to PREVENT the block size increase...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 01:03;5;7;Different people advocate for using Segwit to get lower fees (although realistically I don't think it will make a difference long-term).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 01:02;0;0;It's also in your best interest to not have the blockchain grow 100+ GB every year. Using Segwit enables that. Avoiding Segwit holds it back to a slightly more reasonable rate of growth.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 01:01;0;3;Open source doesn't set release dates. It's ready when it's ready. And why hold back other smart contracts just to wait for Lightning? There's not much point in delaying Segwit.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 01:00;0;0;How is it a disaster?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 01:00;0;0;"Read the whole thing in context. Simply by being unjust, they aren't laws at all.""""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.11.2017 00:59;0;0;You have no authority to make such a demand, so yes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 22:29;0;0;You don't have the right to refuse in the first place.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 22:29;0;0;Laws don't need your consent. You are the subject, not the authority.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 22:16;11;19;It is better not to use Segwit until Lightning is ready.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 22:16;0;0;Your premise is false. There can indeed be laws without threats. The reason for prescribing a specific punishment for violation, is to avoid arbitrariness when someone commits such a crime.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:40;0;0;Legitimate authority is that which is delegated by God.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:39;0;1;God has obliged you to consensually GIVE some portion of your property to the State for its uses.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:34;0;1;God;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:34;0;0;Authority is more than merely a title or a hat.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:32;0;0;To argue that, you would first need to show that civil disobedience can itself be justified.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:30;0;1;It's you giving to the State what you are obliged to.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:30;0;1;No, I don't have to define well-defined words. If you can't have a proper conversation in English, that'll just be the end of it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:27;0;0;Even if Walmart is using their income for evil things, it doesn't mean you're justified in stealing from Walmart.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:22;0;3;Except taxes aren't theft.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:21;1;2;Now you're putting words in my mouth.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:21;0;0;Justification is an objective criteria, not subjective.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:20;0;0;I don't see where you think I made any comment on Jim Crow laws.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:16;0;5;Obligations can arise without contracts. For example, if you damage someone else's property, you are obliged to make reparations for it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:15;0;0;Until you owe it to someone else.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:13;0;1;There's no such thing as unjust laws. Simply by being unjust, they aren't laws at all.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:11;0;4;That's right. Taxes owed aren't your property. But that doesn't in any way deny that you have (or at least could have) private property that is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:07;0;0;We have an obligation to follow just laws, whether there are formalised consequences or not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:06;0;2;Liar.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:06;0;2;Bitcoin doesn't have a problem with minority forks in the first place.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 21:04;0;0;Your conclusion does not follow from your argument.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 20:55;0;2;Not all users supported Segwit.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 20:54;1;4;Taxation is not theft in the first place. Even if there is no vote at all, you still have a moral obligation to pay just taxes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 20:52;1;2;Claiming that the government is threatening you is FUD. I have never been threatened. Maybe you have, but if so, it's only because you refused to voluntarily pay the taxes justly owed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 15:43;0;1;Read what you just posted...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 15:40;0;0;Try reading the whole definition, rather than picking out words to underline.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 15:36;0;1;Try a dictionary.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 15:35;0;0;No, it isn't. You're trying to redefine words as well as morality.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 15:15;0;1;Neither.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 15:15;0;0;And yet the objection to BIP16 remained rational and understood by many others who also upheld the objection (at least at the time BIP16 was released in Core).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 15:04;2;5;I reject Libertarianism. I suggest you read this article: http://www.traditionalmass.org/articles/article.php?id=13&catname=7 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 05:06;1;2;Funny you mention that. It only had 2 before I extended it to 8... Anyhow, precision is the use case, not smaller amounts. Maybe some day (after Lightning is in production), smaller amounts will be useful too.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 04:52;1;4;Claiming reality to be subjective is what is truly delusional.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 04:48;0;2;Delusional describes someone who denies reality, not someone stating facts.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 04:40;0;5;It's the hardfork removing the rule that would need consensus, not the softfork adding it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 04:17;2;16;Miners always must follow the rules of the system, including any new rules introduced in softforks. Violating those rules, as with any rules, is equivalent to a hardfork attempt.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 03:59;1;1;Bitcoin isn't capitalism.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 03:58;0;5;The minimal violation would be to break the new softfork rule directly. BCH went much further than this, changing even more fundamental rules.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 03:43;0;3;Also note that miners can perform such a chain split attack with or without a softfork! So there is no excuse to blame the softfork for the miners choosing to attack the network.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 03:43;1;7;Miners don't decide protocol changes. If miners fail to comply with the new rules, they are attempting a contentious hardfork, and *that* can cause a chain split. But so long as miners don't attack the network this way, there is no chain split from the softfork itself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 03:41;1;2;Capitalism is evil.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 03:39;0;0;What would the Church's Holy Saturday entail/mean for us?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.11.2017 03:33;6;60;They don't, and never have. BIP16 didn't have consensus. Segwit didn't have consensus. Consensus as a rule is only strictly needed for *hardforks*, not softforks. For softforks, it is sufficient that they have widespread support, and do no harm to those who don't support it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.11.2017 16:45;0;6;That's Bitcoin's testnet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.11.2017 15:44;0;0;Sounds like OpenTransactions.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.11.2017 03:54;0;1;They can run a full node already, if you're patient.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.11.2017 02:38;0;0;Intel and AMD CPUs have backdoors built-in these days. I'm not aware of any backdoors in most ARM systems. However, keep in mind ARM is typically much less powerful.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.11.2017 00:36;1;13;Somewhat skeptical, especially hearing about the $7k minimum order... but let's assume good faith, work together, and hope for the best.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 21:59;0;1;Core 0.16 will be a special release ASAP making the hacky support easier to use. Real Segwit support will likely be in 0.17, sometime next year. Some Core developers consider it a priority. I prefer avoiding Segwit (for non-Lightning stuff), so I personally do not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 21:51;0;1;Not really. You can hackily add P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses to it, but that's not quite the same thing as real Segwit support.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 17:00;0;1;How people spend their own time is up to them, not the market. I'm just throwing a thought out here.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 16:51;0;0;It WAS a new one... :p;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 16:42;0;1;Actually, maybe this isn't a productive use of time. Lightning kindof obsoletes all of this anyway, I guess.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 16:28;0;1;47% is not as bad as 99%, which is where you'd get with mass adoption of BIP47.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 16:04;0;0;We already explained why on the bitcoin-dev ML when he first proposed it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 15:57;0;2;No, this convo is just Justus obstinately denying the very real problems and trying to use FUD to discredit people who point them out.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 15:56;0;6;"(Strictly speaking, it wasn't even rejected, since you guys did implement it.) Ever consider having someone revamp it (in a new BIP) with a saner spec addressing these issues? ;)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 15:52;0;1;Maybe. On the other hand, why put so much effort into explaining why a bad idea is a bad idea? It's not like this changes it into a good idea.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 15:49;0;0;Yes, and without resorting to stupid excuses to justify bad designs as you have in the past when you attempted to.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 15:42;0;0;You're just trolling now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 15:38;0;0;Search the bitcoin-dev ML archives for more details.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 15:32;0;0;The design flaw is misusing Bitcoin Scripts and promoting address reuse (which actually HARMS privacy, contrary to the claimed purpose of the BIP!);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 06:05;12;44;New users that stick to Coinbase are a problem. We need a majority of bitcoin transactions to use a full node of their own, or the entire network's security is compromised.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 06:02;0;4;Probably varies from person to person after that. But it's the initial sync that seems to hold most people back from running their own node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 06:01;0;0;But which one do you use for your wallet?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 05:58;1;9;Bandwidth and CPU time for the initial sync.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 05:58;0;1;It's not quite true to say I have no tie to Blocksteam either, though. I was a cofounder, and have done contract work for them since the start. (That doesn't mean they influence my Core dev work, of course.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 05:56;0;0;Correct. Nor many pre-Segwit rules either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 05:56;1;5;Storage has never been the real bottleneck anyway.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 05:44;0;1;Not reliable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 05:37;0;0;I don't know what you're referring to.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 05:37;0;1;Unless you verify the entire rule set, you could be accepting an invalid block.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 05:36;0;7;I don't disagree.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 02:51;0;1;Hmm, how does it work without DNS seeds? Just relying on the hardcoded node list??;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 02:32;0;1;(As a nice bonus, buying Talos is supporting a good cause.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 02:32;0;1;Talos is simply the only sure way to get a non-backdoored high-end PC these days. Since the full node is part of your Bitcoin security, a secure computer to run it is ideal. Depending on your Bitcoin use, however, you might not care too much about Intel or the NSA backdoors.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 01:53;0;0;Ideally, a Talos 2 (https://raptorcs.com/TALOSII/ ). Second-best, an Intel machine with ME cleaner [hopefully] neutering the backdoor. If you are patient, ARM might be a viable option as well. Obviously you would be best avoiding backdoored OSs (Windows/macOS).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 01:25;0;0;I don't think it suffices... but maybe I'm being paranoid.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 01:13;0;5;It arrived damaged. (Which also means you haven't delivered the product I ordered...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 01:11;0;1;Wouldn't you just require the customer take the photo with a unique code on a paper?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 01:00;0;0;I had one survive 3 years. (It's actually still working, but reporting bad sectors, so I don't trust it.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 00:59;0;0;When you destroy the drive, you don't ship it back at all, but send them photos of it being destroyed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 00:52;0;1;It's not the default method, and requires additional effort.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 00:51;0;0;"No, I paid for a working drive. That obligation remains until they ship a working drive (or at least refund me). What I do to the items I didn't order (defective drive) is irrelevant. ;)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 00:42;0;0;I calculate 104 years. But it was for backups, for blockchains.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 00:41;0;1;Regulatory-ily speaking, you're not obliged to return products you didn't order, and they are obliged to deliver the product I did order. So it actually makes sense that they ought to replace the drive even if I don't ship them back the defective one at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 00:28;0;2;They will usually allow you to destroy the drive yourself if it contains sensitive data.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 00:07;0;1;Standard best practices. And what I paid for was a working drive. Arguably I could probably dispute the charge on grounds they didn't deliver.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 00:06;0;0;I wouldn't bet on it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.11.2017 00:05;0;0;Useless in 2017...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2017 23:29;0;1;If two people want different things, that's a reason for an option, not a reason to only allow one.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2017 23:28;0;1;Yeah, hard drive encryption is a good thing. I'm used to strong physical security for backups out of fear of recovery issues, but maybe I'll need to just get over that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2017 23:27;0;1;I don't recall that one, but I assume there was a good reason...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2017 23:25;0;0;If only I'd noticed the issue a few minutes sooner... The backup had only just barely copied the wallets to it. :/;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2017 23:21;0;0;Yes (it also came with a $25 coupon for photo prints, which I can make good use of since my wife likes printed photos).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2017 23:20;0;0;Forced in the sense that Core rejects alternative policies. Limiting by weight can't reliably produce blocks of a desirable size.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2017 23:19;0;1;It was within the 15 day return window. But yes, WD has more reasonable policies, so I'm not actually taking a loss here in practice. (Doesn't justify BestBuy's bad policies, though.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2017 23:17;0;1;Forcing users (in this case, miners) to only use a single policy, and refusing to ship alternative options.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2017 23:16;0;0;Unlikely.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2017 23:15;0;2;8 TB for $105 is a hard deal to beat. Before finding out it's defective, anyway. Most places let you send photos of the destroyed hard drive.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2017 23:12;0;1;Not worth the risk.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2017 23:12;0;2;2017, when basically everyone else understands the need to protect sensitive information and lets you destroy the drive yourself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2017 23:09;23;86;Apparently @ BestBuy will not let you self-destroy defective drives with sensitive information and still get a replacement... something to keep in mind when buying hard drives. (Note that deletion and formatting are NOT sufficient to protect your wallet!);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.11.2017 13:32;0;0;Sure;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.11.2017 04:15;0;1;That's because miners are still making only 1 MB blocks on average. Note also that stale blocks remain in .bitcoin of unpruned nodes, so some variation is to be expected regardless.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;20.11.2017 20:02;0;0;It's all optional, so miners that don't want it can just opt not to use it. No need for a vote.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.11.2017 19:55;0;0;They have no effect on P2P relay...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.11.2017 19:54;0;1;Coin age priority and maxblocksize are miner policy features, not wallet... Maxblocksize can theoretically be done in external software, but doing coin age priority anywhere else would be convoluted and inefficient at least.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.11.2017 19:52;0;1;Nobody is suggesting getting rid of these direct incentives... But miners who are more long-term invested or altruistic shouldn't be alienated by developers.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.11.2017 19:50;0;0;On the contrary, freedom of religion is condemned heresy, and Catholics are all obliged to reject it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;20.11.2017 19:45;0;0;Because fees have little to do with block size. (Also, Segwit hasn't been fully deployed yet anyway...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.11.2017 19:42;0;1;Yes, basically the same thing. Someone needs to log it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;20.11.2017 01:25;0;0;It doesn't NEED to be that nuanced. It's sufficient to simply observe Francis's present teaching of heresy, and apply Catholic doctrine. V2 contradicted Catholic doctrine - that's what heresy IS, by definition.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.11.2017 01:20;0;0;It's really pretty simple. Catholic doctrine holds that heretics can't be popes. Francis publicly teaches heresy. Therefore, Francis cannot be a pope.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.11.2017 01:19;0;0;Atheism is irrational. I'm just giving the conclusion that logically follows from the premise of atheism.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.11.2017 01:18;0;1;ASICs don't necessarily lead to centralisation. That was true in 2012 and is true today still.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.11.2017 01:17;0;0;The Catholic Church has always held that the power to consecrate new bishops is possessed by every current bishop. As with during every other interregnum, the bishops receive their authority directly from Christ and no particular external approval is necessary.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.11.2017 01:15;0;0;I /don't/ sympathise with the SSPX. Their heresies are no more justifiable than Francis's. If you follow Francis (who the Church teaches CANNOT be a pope) then you are unfortunately not quite within the Catholic Church.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.11.2017 01:14;0;2;What happens when the minority voids the stake of everyone who voted for it?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.11.2017 00:02;1;2;That's irrelevant. Both for and against a hardfork can choose to ignore the vote at will, and without active consent, the vote will be ignored by default.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.11.2017 23:35;0;0;Do you really want to enshrine the current consensus rules in hardware??;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.11.2017 23:33;0;2;In this case, they are promoting it with falsehoods. On-chain voting doesn't meaningfully change the inherent necessity of consensus for hardforks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.11.2017 23:32;0;3;Almost all other PoW algorithms are not centralised today and would at the very least take time (at least a year) to become centralised. If it happens again, we can change again until it doesn't (or we have a better solution).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.11.2017 23:32;0;2;Bitcoin also had a principle of PoW change if/when mining becomes centralised. That appears to have changed with the influx of newbies over the last few years who were not brought fully up to speed on such issues.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.11.2017 22:45;6;30;So I am forced to change my mind: miners do in fact control IF a hardfork will happen (albeit not necessarily the details of said HF). Simply because apparently without miners shutting down Bitcoin completely, the community won't come to consensus for even security improvements.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.11.2017 22:45;3;33;Regardless of confusion on poll wording, it seems clear there's still notable opposition to a PoW change, and as it is a hardfork, none can be done at the moment, even despite Bitcoin's somewhat desperate need for it.https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/929647172659896322 …;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;18.11.2017 17:08;0;1;No, you read me wrong. One reason centralised mining is a problem, is because we are forced to trust miners to act as incentivised. We shouldn't depend on trusting specific people to behave as incentivised. Whether that be Bitmain or botnet operators.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.11.2017 16:58;0;0;I don't understand your question.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.11.2017 16:54;0;1;Botnets were never a centralising problem for Bitcoin in the first place.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;18.11.2017 16:00;1;4;Centralised hashpower makes it easier to attack, because you just need to compromise the few entities that control it all. With a new PoW, Bitcoin will become even MORE expensive to attack.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;18.11.2017 04:15;0;1;MintSIM is pre-pay, every 3 months or up to a year (at a lower rate).

LukeDashjr;16.11.2017 18:43;0;0;No. If you're investing in the currency itself, you want to buy the currency, not miners for it. Buying miners in that case just adds to the risk and costs without improving benefits.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;16.11.2017 18:35;0;1;The current situation is already problematic, since it forces the network to trust Bitmain. Why do we even have miners, if we're willing to trust a Fed-equivalent?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;16.11.2017 16:38;0;0;If it could and was desirable, we wouldn't need a blockchain at all. But this isn't even a desirable trait to have, as it would amplify the harm done by spam.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.11.2017 13:30;0;0;No, even before the first SHA2 ASICs, we had the midstate optimisation. With ASICBoost, it got even worse.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.11.2017 13:22;0;1;Changing PoW every 6 months would likely prevent ASICs from being made at all... but that shouldn't be our goal IMO. The ideal algorithm has the property that the best ASIC is obvious.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.11.2017 13:16;0;0;There was a high chance of PoW change when SHA2 ASICs were first announced. It didn't stop ASICs the first time, so I see no basis to claim it would deter them this time either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.11.2017 13:14;0;0;You mean the EX-miners? They don't really matter anymore if we go ahead with it (that's part of the goal). Anything less than cold-turkey is significantly more complicated, and has no upsides.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.11.2017 13:13;0;1;Yes, it was mostly a waste of time (and also inconsistent with Catholicism).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;14.11.2017 22:41;0;1;Then the old PoW has no value and isn't really mining the chain at all.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 21:24;1;4;Looking pretty low right now, sadly. But maybe things will change in the coming weeks...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 20:51;0;4;You're welcome. I know I appreciate easy decisions.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 20:47;3;49;Then the world in which we live can't support a decentralised currency. (Or we can change PoW until businesses realise they won't have a business anymore if they centralise...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 20:46;2;54;The bug is that mining is viable as a business. It isn't meant to be.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 20:23;0;6;The PoW algo itself is part of the problem. ASICBoost effectively compromises it, and even aside from the increased R&D to use it, we still couldn't without being vulnerable to patent lawsuits.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 20:14;0;2;(Hint: if everyone else but you already agreed to it, then your agreement to it means the network WILL accept it!);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 20:13;0;2;Maybe we don't know how secure the network would be, but we do know it would be MORE secure than it is now... And whether the network adopts it or not is something we can determine before attempting it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 20:10;0;0;I don't give investment advice...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 20:05;0;0;Why are you asking me? I never suggested BCH was a good idea.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 15:50;0;0;There's only a (meaningful) split if it lacks consensus.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 15:49;0;1;What? No...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 15:25;0;0;Not possible, no.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 15:22;0;0;It's essentially the same as anti-gun regulations: you disarm the good guys, but you can't disarm the bad guys, so now only the bad guys have the guns.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 15:16;0;0;Because presumably by choosing an anti-ASIC algorithm, you've defined the good behaviour to not use ASICs, as well as made it anti-competitive/centralising to build ASICs. So only the attacker would have sufficient motivation to do so.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 14:48;0;0;Because only the attacker will have ASICs, and the good guys won't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 14:47;0;0;"Not ideal"" is an understatement. Centralised mining provides ZERO security. Non-ASIC may not be ideal, but it's only temporary and still better than the nothing we get from centralised mining.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 14:43;0;0;Making it harder gives an advantage to the attacker.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 14:43;0;0;There is no security from centralised mining.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 13:53;0;10;I'm talking about changing Bitcoin, not making some stupid altcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 13:51;0;0;There'd be much more mining than we have today, because everyone with a computer could participate.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 13:50;0;0;1) That won't fix the problems with SHA2. 2) Bitmain has patents on the SHA2 exploits needed to make efficient ASICs.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 12:55;0;0;Bitcoin IS vulnerable today. PoW change is just a RISK of BECOMING vulnerable. So clearly the latter is better?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 12:46;0;0;"The issue isn't miners leaving; it's SHA2 no longer serving the purpose it was meant for, in a way that compromises Bitcoin's security.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 12:29;0;2;Also that Bitmain uses those ASICs rather than exclusively selling them. For every 1 Th/s you buy from Bitmain, you enable them to put another 2+ Th/s of their own online.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 12:28;0;0;Litecoin has been a scam since long before Bitmain and F2Pool.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 12:27;0;1;Right, and it wouldn't be an altcoin, just real Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 12:26;0;0;ASICBoost and Bitmain's monopoly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 12:17;0;2;Unfortunately, Bitcoin has a long way to go before we'll get consensus on that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 12:16;0;19;They seem okay with being called BCH.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 12:14;1;2;All current Bitcoin mining ASICs would not be functional for Bitcoin (they could mine BCH or Freicoin still). Bitcoin mining would return to CPUs and GPUs, at least temporarily, resetting centralisation back to a reasonably decentralised state, and discouraging re-centralising it;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 12:10;0;0;Replacing SHA2 PoW with (eg) SHA3 or BLAKE2 PoW. They all work the same way, just using a different mathematical algorithm.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 12:09;0;0;Not in a meaningful way, I think.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 11:54;1;5;Note that Segwit itself does little to help in this respect... it's Lightning we need for that. But the premise (that bigger blocks alone are responsible for miner centralisation) is wrong, and overlooks Bitmain's monopoly.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 11:41;0;7;What I was trying to convey, is that we are *already* beyond the point where using SHA2 for PoW algorithm is not secure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.11.2017 11:38;0;2;I hear SHA3 is pretty ASIC-friendly. And SHA2 has become ASIC-resistant in advent of ASICBoost, so almost certainly.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;11.11.2017 20:40;0;5;But it hasn't and almost certainly won't. Why should the situation suddenly change after years of getting worse and worse?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2017 20:39;0;0;Not without the same harm as increasing the block size... anyhow, makes more sense to think about real problems, like miner centralisation...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.11.2017 20:38;0;1;Because there must be a way to compare two different chains. With a single algorithm, that's as simple as adding the work up and seeing which has more. But there's no way to valid different kinds of work against each other.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;10.11.2017 18:15;0;5;No, there isn't. The best we can do is make it very easy to build the ASICs (reducing R&D to become a manuf), and incentivise the manufacturers to sell it widely and diversely.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;10.11.2017 11:17;0;0;"No, it's no one entity should have too much control"". The abuse in this case is self-mining rather than selling the hardware";;;;;;https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/928929662667055105;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2017 11:16;2;2;Anything more than 30% under control of one nation's citizens should be terrifying. We should aim to never have any entity in control of more than 10%. Domestic mining at 30% doesn't accomplish this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2017 09:48;0;3;Even just the mining aspect being centralised is deadly to Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2017 09:35;0;2;Because if you don't sell them, you'll centralise the network and the community will make them worthless with a PoW change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2017 09:29;0;3;Sure, so long as they don't mine themselves, and sell fairly (no bulk discounts to industrial mines).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2017 09:28;0;1;Miners AREN'T decentralised, though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2017 09:28;0;2;"As soon as we have consensus. (When to activate is another matter to be considered; there doesn't seem to be an obvious perfect answer there.)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2017 09:25;0;1;It's not retaliation. It's defense against centralisation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2017 09:24;0;0;I don't see why IP cloaking is important...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2017 09:23;0;1;Avoiding their chips being made useless IS self-interest.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2017 09:18;0;1;Hmm. I need to think on this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2017 09:16;0;0;Ideally, people shouldn't blindly trust devs either. Check the facts and arguments, hire someone who can read code to review that too. Sadly, most people can't review code, and I'm not sure if there's a good solution to that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;10.11.2017 09:14;0;0;Building new ASICs takes time, and we can just change again if they re-centralise.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 22:45;0;0;Unfortunately, I don't think we have consensus on that yet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 20:02;0;1;At the very least, ASICs for them aren't monopolised at this time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 19:31;0;10;We DO see miners trying to break rules. That's EXACTLY what 2X was.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 18:56;0;4;Unsolicited scamcoin promotion = I block you.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 18:55;0;10;If Bitmain liquidates maybe.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 18:50;0;1;I passed on Eligius to wizkid057's capable management years ago. But growing smaller pools in general is still a good idea, yes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 18:49;0;7;Right now, there are only a few miners who make up a majority of the hashrate. Acceptable numbers would be less than 30% controlled by entities subject to a given jurisdiction, and no more than 10% controlled by a single entity.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 18:47;0;2;Except SHA256 isn't random. It's assigned by Bitmain. To get random, we need to change PoW.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 18:38;0;0;So why have proof-of-work at all? We could just pick Alice and Bob and let them mine without expending energy. The block reward will still incentivise them to act economically rational.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 18:28;0;1;That won't happen while Bitmain has a monopoly and can put 10 Th/s of their own online using the profits of every 1 Th/s they sell to someone else.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 18:21;0;9;The math says Bitcoin is vulnerable when mining is centralised.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 18:14;17;148;"The miners have incentive to avoid breaking Bitcoin, so we should trust them."" begs the question- why use proof-of-work at all rather than just assign the miners? (Reason is to avoid a need for trusting miners!)""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 17:27;0;0;Mining pools aren't necessarily a point of centralisation (see p2pool and GBT). But in any case, the worse alternative of insecure cloud mining cannot be prevented, so there's little value blocking even centralised pool mining.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 16:03;0;1;Definitely false, considering they've had YEARS of warning now. PoW change conditions were met a long time ago, and are now overdue.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 16:03;0;0;It's like saying you won't make SATA hard drives because PATA hard drives are obsolete. XD;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 15:58;0;1;That's unrelated positive or negative with a PoW change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 15:54;0;3;Then almost every business will lose $$$ until we end up with only non-malicious businesses left. Good outcome.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 15:42;0;1;And? So long as the future manufacturers don't abuse their position, they have nothing to worry about.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 15:23;0;0;Welcome to 2017, where that has been proven wrong at least in practice.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 15:21;0;3;Then all they need to do is not abuse their position. Not rocket science.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 12:19;1;2;Maybe. I also wonder if the BLAKE variants are similar enough such that we could support all of them - then manufacturers could choose different targets, and we could softfork disable only the ones implemented by malicious miners...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 10:40;0;4;Hopefully whoever makes ASICs for the next PoW algorithm won't abuse their position, and no further changes will be needed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 10:32;0;1;There does need to be consensus, but it's a disaster that newbies were not educated on the necessity of doing it when mining centralised.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 10:31;0;6;PoW changes were on the table before SHA2 ASICs were ever on the market. The understanding that we'd change PoW algorithm if it resulted in centralised mining was there from the start. Bankrupting corrupt chip firms that ignored this warning and abused their position is GOOD.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 09:53;0;5;No, it would only disincentive them from abusing their position.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 09:52;0;1;I don't see a proof-of-memory here. You're doing hashing, which isn't done by memory. You also lack cheap verification and progress-free, both critical attributes for a PoW algorithm. Finally, since you throw away the previous hash when done with it, I can just reuse that memory.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 09:09;0;0;"I can only guess... (not thinking about whether their profit is from valuation increases rather than mining; indirect money laundry; getting someone else to pay the expenses; at least some altruistic; etc)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 08:54;0;0;An inefficient SHA256d is simple. Actually producing a *competitive* chip is complicated, due to weaknesses found after Bitcoin launched. What back end? You mean the open source mining software myself and others have written without pay from the manufacturers?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 08:52;0;1;"You could make an ASIC to work with any of the changed"" algorithms...""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 08:51;0;0;Those chips are already unprofitable to run, except for Bitmain (which we shouldn't care about at this point).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 06:01;0;1;That changed with the advent of ASICBoost - and even to a lesser degree with other optimisations - which made the ideal SHA2 ASIC complicated to implement.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 06:00;0;0;Huh? You have that backward. The early days of ASIC mining were far better than now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 05:58;0;3;They already have a utility guarantee in the form of BCH. (It'd be good for BCH too!);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 05:58;0;16;"Boring"" seems too boring a word for it. XD""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.11.2017 05:57;0;0;They wouldn't need to go that far. Most people can probably be bribed to quit for cheaper than an assassination of them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 21:32;0;6;It shouldn't be a last resort.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 21:19;0;1;No, it didn't, actually.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 18:47;0;2;No, you're redefining Bitcoin now. Read the source code.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 18:40;0;1;"There is no 1 or 2 in the code. Blocks can be up to 4 MB now. PoW is NOT any more fundamental than the block size limit, not at all. The limit is STILL needed to limit spam these days; more than it was in the early days, in fact.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 18:37;0;1;"But those farms wouldn't have an advantage over everyone else. ;)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 18:36;0;12;In layman's terms, the Bitcoin network today is insecure, and relies on trusting Bitmain. Changing PoW can make it secure again.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 18:36;0;16;It's needed because Bitmain has broken and monopolised the SHA2 PoW, turning it into an assigned-by-Bitmain more than proof-of-work. Changing it gets us back to real proof-of-work, and hopefully it will stay decentralised.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 18:34;0;5;https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/asic-faq.pdf …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 18:34;0;0;That's the idea.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 18:33;0;0;Deciding last minute eliminates any advance knowledge advantage.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 17:31;1;4;It's not possible to keep it secret.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 17:24;0;1;No, it doesn't mean that. Changing PoW is exactly the same as changing the block size limit.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 17:20;0;1;They're talking about attacking, not merely leaving. And miner defection to an alltcoin has nothing to do with Nakamoto consensus anyway.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 16:20;0;0;Certainly can't do worse than SHA2 is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 16:18;0;9;Changing the PoW as planned in 2012 isn't defeat..;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 16:17;0;1;A mixture gets you the worst attributes of both.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 16:17;0;8;ASIC-resistant is generally a bad thing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 16:16;0;2;So many reasons this is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 16:16;0;0;Also, why do you oppose following through with the original plan to change PoW under our current circumstances???;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 16:15;0;0;And when Bitcoin doesn't work because the SHA2 issuer attacks?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 16:14;0;3;Multi-algo is a can of worms.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 14:57;18;84;"IMO we should try for a simple-to-ASIC PoW algorithm like SHA3, Keccak, or a BLAKE variant. But despite my reservations, I'm also willing to consider trying a well-tested memory-hard"" PoW algorithm if the community prefers that direction.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 14:49;0;0;AFAIK the improvement is at least in part related to POWER9's better memory bus...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 14:39;0;0;POWER9 is already proving to have an advantage over the market (at least with CryptoNight), and that's without any real optimisation effort...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 12:43;0;0;Kind of tongue-in-cheek.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 12:35;1;4;Bitmain says they're voluntarily leaving. So all we need to do is change PoW and presumably they won't follow.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 12:30;0;0;I didn't agree with that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 12:23;0;2;"Not sure every few years is regular"", but okay. :p""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 12:23;0;1;Then what are they suing would-be competitors over? Regardless, it's anti-competitive.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 12:20;1;5;Existing hash power has already chosen 2X, but no: they have a choice between 2X, BCH, or even Freicoin or minor alts. It won't weaken the network, because SHA2 is broken as a PoW algorithm, so *any* PoW change is automatically an improvement to security.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 12:05;5;11;SHA2 wasn't known to be weak until Bitcoin incentivised breaking it. The only way we're going to find a strong PoW algorithm, is trial and error. And changing when an algorithm get centralised also disincentivises centralisation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 12:03;3;7;Extreme uptick? The plan to change PoW algorithm in these circumstances was established in 2012, before any mass-production ASICs were available! Those criteria were met over a year ago. There is no reason for current miners to expect the algorithm to NOT change ASAP.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 11:56;0;1;Not sure what you mean. SHA2 has not achieved the goal.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 11:56;0;4;That doesn't make any sense, and sat is inherently centralised.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 11:55;0;1;There *can't* be, since Bitmain patented their exploit. (And has in the last few months begun suing potential competitors.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 11:54;0;1;Not to mention a CPU manuf can fake them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 11:21;0;0;That's what people have been saying for half a decade now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 11:20;0;2;That's just handing Bitcoin to GPU manufacturers on a silver platter.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 11:18;0;2;A sad outcome of failure to achieve the goal (decentralised mining), but perhaps next time you'll do better with less hostile manufacturers?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 11:16;1;13;Even if we can find a way to make PoS work (doubtful), money isn't exactly known to avoid centralisation problems either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 11:14;0;3;ASIC resistance is exactly what gives the first ASIC a huge advantage. Using an ASIC-friendly algorithm minimises it, and makes it less likely the first will be first for very long.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 11:13;0;0;Mind you, *centralised* ASIC mining is virtually worthless, regardless of how much more efficient it is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.11.2017 07:02;0;0;If restarting the solution-finding is expensive, then I don't see how you can claim it is progress-free...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;7.11.2017 08:53;0;0;You don't. If damage is widescale enough, the network could theoretically revert and change PoW, but that likely can't undo ALL the damage.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;7.11.2017 06:31;0;5;In fact, they have more to gain by destroying Bitcoin now than from mining it honestly. (Except they overlook that we won't go along w/ it.);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;7.11.2017 06:01;0;0;Same logic for developers (although the system isn't designed to eliminate developer profit).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;7.11.2017 05:36;0;2;Regardless, let's hope Jeff stays in good health. (Or his health improves, if not already in good health.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.11.2017 05:35;0;0;What?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.11.2017 05:33;0;2;(I'm not saying we should prevent it per se, but going out of the way to enable profit shouldn't be a focus.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.11.2017 05:31;0;0;Mining isn't supposed to make a profit in the first place.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.11.2017 05:31;0;8;Even 30% under control of people from a single country should be seen as unacceptable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.11.2017 05:30;0;5;The HKA was 100% fulfilled on the developer side. We made proposals (and they were rejected).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.11.2017 05:26;0;4;How so? (Also, having >30% HP makes them an attack on the network, and attacks should be resisted, not given a voice.);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;7.11.2017 05:20;2;29;Observation: Now that a real market-valued SHA2 cryptocurrency exists again (BCH), SHA2 miners NO LONGER have ANY* skin in the game...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.11.2017 05:09;0;0;In fact, I assert that Bitcoin can be used just as easily for obedience, as it can be abused for disobedience. (W/o choice, one can't obey.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.11.2017 04:51;0;2;"I guess my point here is: please don't try to make the government pissed off at Bitcoin. ;)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.11.2017 04:48;0;0;Pride is a sin. But if the government isn't aware of my intent to obey, they might preemptively try to use force, which would be annoying.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;7.11.2017 00:06;0;0;Looks like typical FUD.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.11.2017 00:02;0;2;No, it isn't a disobedience tool. It is money.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.11.2017 00:01;0;0;No, I do not. (Except in the case of unjust laws, which aren't really even laws at all.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 23:57;0;0;No, there isn't anything even remotely similar about it, so there's no way to differentiate, certainly not in mere tweets.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 14:05;0;0;No, UASF is not a sybil attack, just a softfork. Sybil attacks are something entirely different.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 13:43;0;0;An altcoin with block sizes up to nearly 8 MB.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 10:56;0;3;2/ Bitcoin, on the other hand, can be comfortably divided down to satoshis. No lower-value compliment is needed nor useful.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 10:56;0;1;1/ Gold is worth too much for low value transactions. One small piece is ~$4k! Silver provides that compliment to gold.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 10:40;2;5;No. Masturbation is a very grave sin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 10:35;0;1;Regardless, the WORST-CASE scenario for a hardfork attempt (becoming an altcoin) is still the same as your best-case intentional-altcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 10:34;2;5;If my government simply ASKS me to stop, I will submit as a faithful subject. Disobedience is not something I consider acceptable.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 08:29;0;0;Easily proven wrong. Price has never had any correlation to block sizes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 08:29;1;2;That's not useful.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 08:27;0;0;It's just as easy for govts to bring Litecoin down too. Every single failure case for Bitcoin also applies to Litecoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 08:26;0;0;Litecoin isn't the first ANYTHING. It copied scrypt from Tenebrix, and there were many other altcoins beforehand. Some even still alive.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 08:25;0;1;And if Bitcoin must be abandoned for some reason, better to start a new, legitimate altcoin from scratch, than adopt Litecoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 08:25;0;1;If Bitmain can destroy Bitcoin, alts are just as vulnerable to the same attack.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 08:23;0;0;Price has absolutely nothing to do with it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 08:21;0;1;Nothing like it. There ISN'T a reason Litecoin exists. It serves absolutely NO legitimate purpose.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 08:20;0;0;Furthermore, running both Litecoin and Bitcoin requires resources for full nodes of both. Same harmful effects as a block size increase.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 08:19;1;16;Litecoin does absolutely nothing for Bitcoin or scaling. Pretending it does just makes you culpable for the scamming.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 07:10;2;26;Even if Lightning *didn't* succeed for some reason, Litecoin would STILL have the same problems scaling as Bitcoin, so useless either way.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 02:06;0;1;No, the majority of the Core developers came around by the end. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segwit_support …;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.11.2017 01:00;0;2;No, a softfork is sufficient.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2017 19:32;0;0;For better or worse, everyone with any qualifications (mostly experience) is probably already working on Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2017 14:45;0;0;If you think we have an excess of developers, you're very mistaken. There is more work to do for the immediate future than we have time for.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.11.2017 11:48;2;4;Pruned state cannot be transferred securely, which is why pruned nodes must download all the blockchain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2017 04:06;0;0;At the cost of a centralised authority. Not worth it, and defeats the goals of Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2017 03:10;0;2;It's an ugly upgrade, so would rather avoid it as long as practical.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.11.2017 02:18;0;6;There's been vague plans in general development thought since at least ~2012.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.11.2017 12:23;0;0;No, only if you turn pruning off.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.11.2017 04:02;0;0;I cannot honestly recommend storing bitcoins on a phone, or using light wallets in general. For now, I use Greenbits w/ a very low balance.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.11.2017 14:24;0;2;If you have the space, unpruned has some more features, but pruning is available if you need space.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.11.2017 12:23;0;2;Even with pruning, you need to download it all. It just saves disk space if necessary.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.11.2017 12:00;1;6;No need to store the chain - pruned nodes can still be full nodes. But by protect the chain, I mean PoW change as necessary.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.11.2017 11:13;2;40;Only if the community fails to protect Bitcoin, in which case altcoins are doomed as well.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;1.11.2017 11:08;0;0;You can't rely on miners not producing larger blocks. If miners cared what was safe, we wouldn't even be seeing 1 MB blocks today.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.11.2017 11:07;0;0;If you set the parameter wrong at any given point in time, you're insecure and/or non-functional.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;1.11.2017 10:38;0;0;You mean 300 kB (and that's only if activated 11 months ago). 1 MB would be crossed in 2024, giving nearly 7 years for users to deploy it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.11.2017 10:35;0;0;Hmm, maybe. But that $10k is a precise number... and if you forget to update at the exact moment, you're locked out and/or vulnerable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.11.2017 09:49;0;0;No, it won't work. Nodes would be forced to constantly set the exact same price. Furthermore, safe block sizes don't change based on price.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.10.2017 21:40;0;2;So... why are you lying about what I said?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.10.2017 21:31;0;0;Whenever someone says they don't want to or can't run a full node, I ask why. Almost every time, the answer comes down to block size.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.10.2017 17:43;0;0;But that's like saying CVE-2010-5139 shouldn't be fixed because it took away 184 billion bitcoins from the guy who exploited the bug. :p;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.10.2017 17:09;0;1;Pretty much... except typically the bottleneck is bandwidth and CPU time, not disk space (which can also be pruned).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 08:17;0;0;No, it isn't the same. BCH is a new altcoin, and BCH given to Bitcoin holders was given before it was public minable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 07:51;0;8;The cost to get into making ASICs is higher, so fewer people can afford it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 07:49;0;0;We do sometimes call out people who misrepresent Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 07:48;0;2;No. ASIC-resistant just gives ASIC a bigger advantage.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 07:38;0;7;But telling the truth about Litecoin is the same as admitting it has no purpose. (Also, at the time, Bitcoin DID have low fees...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 07:35;0;11;My tiff is with Litecoin, not @ SatoshiLite. Stop trying to make it personal.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 07:28;0;3;LOL, they claimed GPU resistance... And as soon as that fell, the claims of ASIC resistance began.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 06:47;0;0;Now you're just trolling. Lightning is more p2p than Bitcoin's blockchain. The peers are every user.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 05:26;0;1;Lightning is a trustless p2p protocol that uses smart contracts on-chain to guarantee the transfer. Bitcoin is not yet grandma-ready.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 04:26;0;0;If you don't verify every block, you can't see if a transaction is in the chain, because you don't know what the chain is.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 04:25;0;2;Premining to a snapshot is no less a premine than any other premined distribution.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 04:23;0;4;Calling Litecoin faster is by definition scamming since you are misrepresenting its traits.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 04:22;0;0;I did back it up. Troll is what you are?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 04:22;0;5;Hint: It's *not* @ jratcliff who has no idea what premine is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 04:20;0;0;And the only way to do that is to strictly enforce that payments to you are confirmed with your own full node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 04:20;0;0;No, it isn't a hardfork. Hardforks don't result in two chains. BCH is a premined altcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 04:19;0;1;Miners don't decide protocol changes. If not for Litecoin, we could have taken more time on UASF.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 04:17;0;0;Yes, it is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 04:16;0;8;Roger is lying through his teeth.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 04:15;0;6;I call BCH an altcoin because that's what it is. It isn't Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 04:15;0;1;No, it isn't (to both questions).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 04:11;0;2;Why is one distribution method better than another?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 04:06;0;0;No, I don't. BCH isn't the original angle. The original plan proved to be impossible.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.10.2017 04:04;0;2;Litecoin/Charlie didn't invent scrypt mining. ArtForz did that. Charlie just copied it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2017 21:26;0;0;Because proof-of-stake doesn't work (yet?).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2017 21:25;0;2;Ah. Wouldn't go to Disney even for free though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2017 21:06;0;1;(It's a shame Universal got rid of the Terminator 3D ride... XD);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2017 21:05;0;2;Hmm, free park tickets? What's that about? :p;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2017 21:02;0;0;Working on some major changes for BIP 115 to address concerns with its current design. Plan is to make it a static prop. like locktime.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2017 21:01;0;0;It's not a decision, it's an observation. The point of PoW is to establish a canonical ordering of transactions in valid blocks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2017 06:22;0;9;That's correct. Nobody can be forced to use any chain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2017 06:11;1;12;No, BIP 202 is Peer Protocol for Lightning Channel Management;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2017 06:09;4;24;Bitcoin won't come to a halt. If we need to, we can just change the PoW algorithm.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2017 06:09;0;0;I don't see anything to debunk.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2017 06:01;0;1;Not sure what I'm supposed to do with that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.10.2017 04:22;0;2;"Not sure what I'm being paged about. It just says This Tweet is unavailable""...""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 22:41;0;0;A resumable validation state is already stored. Otherwise, you'd need to re-do the initial blockchain sync every time you lost it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 17:52;0;0;Liar.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 17:51;0;2;*More* users and transactions. Handling all that more efficiently.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 17:50;0;0;Every single reasonably reliable polling metric shows strong opposition to 2X.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 14:01;0;0;It's a useless metric at best. Miners will simply make sure to mine an empty block every week to block it. And an excuse to block a change;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 13:59;0;0;Read your own tweets. 95% is technically insufficient. It's not a decision someone makes, it's a technical requirement.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 13:58;0;0;No, it isn't detectable in code, because miners can make blocks at any time retroactively. Also, 100 blocks per 2 weeks isn't unusable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 13:57;0;0;No, it isn't. Code can't even measure users.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 13:57;0;0;No. You can use any sane definition of the community, and a majority of it still opposes 2X.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 13:56;0;0;Scalability and speed are two different things. On-chain will likely never be faster than 1 hour confirmation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 06:55;0;3;Only if you don't count Namecoin, and even then, it's a stretch and only by luck and marketing. It has no real use.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 06:46;0;5;"And why are you not suspicious of a P&D scam by Litecoin, when it launched claiming CPU only"" despite the creator of scrypt PoW using GPUs?""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 06:29;0;4;Why do you select out premine? Premining isn't even scammy, so long as it's properly disclosed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 06:15;0;0;LOTS of scams don't have intent to steal.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 06:14;0;5;Indeed, almost all alts are scams. Just because there are many scams doesn't make them any less of scams.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 05:54;0;1;Pretty much.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 05:53;0;3;Except it really is a scam. I wasn't and am not wrong about this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 05:53;0;1;Clear or not, 2X isn't what NYA agreed to.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.10.2017 01:32;0;3;Hashpower is irrelevant and doesn't decide protocol changes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 23:42;0;3;It would enable ordinary people to mine again.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 23:36;0;6;2X is the only fake news here.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 23:34;1;4;It doesn't matter whether it is or isn't. Miners don't decide protocol changes, especially not hardforks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 23:34;0;5;No, it's the truth.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 23:24;0;2;If the original Bitcoin ceased to exist or be usable, for more than 3 months.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 23:23;0;0;It's not as bad as the alternatives?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 23:22;0;8;False. Miner signalling was deprecated by BIP148. They had no choice.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 22:47;10;86;Miners don't decide protocol changes. Segwit was locked in by BIP148 before 2X was ever a thing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 22:03;0;1;Obviously not. There isn't even a need for 1 MB blocks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 22:02;0;0;Nope, it doesn't work that way.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 22:02;0;0;No, you're lying.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 22:02;2;5;Litecoin has plenty of (less well-known) scammers as well.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 22:00;1;4;You're delusional if you think there is ANY chance of 2X being more than an alt. We can change PoW algo if necessary to protect Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 21:58;0;0;Read the rest of the tweets in the thread.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 21:55;0;9;Not lying. What you said has NOTHING to do what what I just said.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 21:53;0;7;Note the conditional there. I see no reason we *must* use an altcoin for scaling.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 21:52;0;0;That's a technical fact. It doesn't need agreement.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 21:50;1;5;There isn't a short term problem. 1 MB blocks is more than enough. Bitcoin will not be in a mainstream form for years either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 21:49;0;0;What nonsense is this? Those of us who partook in HKA, DID follow through with it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 21:47;1;8;Shorter block interval does not make confirmation faster. Now you need 24 blocks instead of 6. BCH isn't Bitcoin and is irrelevant to this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 21:35;0;0;A supermajority of the economy OPPOSES 2X.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 21:20;1;2;That's my point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 21:19;0;0;lol, no.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 21:13;0;2;The point is that nobody agreed to it, so there is nothing to back out of.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 12:45;0;1;RBF. Start with a small fee, and slowly increase it until it's enough.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 12:32;0;13;Big blocks don't make Bitcoin faster nor fees smaller (at least not substantially). To learn about Segwit, read https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/ …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 12:22;0;15;Segwit was never intended to make Bitcoin faster. That's Lightning.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 12:03;36;166;"There is no such thing as SegWit 1MB blocks"". SegWit already upgraded block size to 2-4 MB.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 11:35;0;0;It's not faster, though, and cheaper only because it has less demand.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 10:33;0;2;Devs only propose rules. Miners only order transactions. Users decide and enforce the rules.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 10:30;0;3;"Yeah, that was basically my first thought when I saw the NYA...Activate Segwit, then deploy using it in our wallets to bring block size up""""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 10:01;0;1;Not ANYTHING, mind you. Freicoin's demurrage is pretty fundamentally incompatible with Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 08:34;0;1;I'm neither shilling Litecoin nor promoting BCH.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 08:31;1;16;I'm pretty sure that angle is fatally flawed, but at least they're TRYING to do something useful.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 08:31;4;36;At least they have a design plan that isn't merely cloning everything Bitcoin does. They're trying to approach scaling from a new angle.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 08:30;0;1;How do I bully him without even mentioning him or talking to him? You're making this personal for no reason. And no, LTC is no better.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 08:29;0;0;Those are averages, not limits. Some blocks will be above. Some below.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 08:29;0;0;Indeed, they make Bitcoin look bad. Someone is screwed over by some scamcoin, and then they assume Bitcoin must be the same.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 08:27;0;3;Not semantics in the discussion of whether Bitcoin can survive it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 08:26;52;152;Litecoin is no better suited for low value payments than Bitcoin is. And if we must use an altcoin for that, I prefer BCH.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 08:14;0;3;It's no more viable than the thousands of other scamcoins. They're just ICOs with a blockchain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 07:16;0;13;But 2X is not a honest representation of what was agreed on in the NYA anyway.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 07:14;2;62;Miners are not the entire community and long ago abandoned any sincere effort to represent the entire community.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 07:02;10;37;Because Litecoin is a scam.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 07:02;0;8;No, they're not even trying to force anyone. At most, they might fraudulently deceive people.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 06:19;0;5;They can't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 05:35;0;2;Then hardforks are completely impractical, because that is what they as a matter of technical fact REQUIRE to succeed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 05:07;0;0;LOL, gotta blame someone else, eh?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 05:06;0;11;Now you're just trolling.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 04:30;0;1;BCH isn't 2 MB nor a hardfork either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 04:30;0;0;You're confusing typical block sizes with the block size limit. There's a difference. Regardless, 4 MB is also not 2 MB.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 04:29;3;25;It is indeed 8 MB. What differentiates an altcoin from a hardfork is consensus from the entire community.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.10.2017 03:33;49;225;"Reminder:Nobody is backing out"" of the NYA. They agreed to only 2 MB as a hardfork. 2X is an 8 MB altcoin instead";;;;;;https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/923361947004874752;;
LukeDashjr;25.10.2017 22:16;0;0;It already is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.10.2017 12:46;0;1;The validation state doesn't depend merely on registers or RAM. It is stored on disk. (Also, I haven't been a miner in some time now.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.10.2017 21:05;0;1;It's several GB. And trusting miners is a TERRIBLE idea.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.10.2017 20:58;0;0;No, and I'm not sure it's theoretically possible either. Keep in mind, any PoW must be cheap for every full node (including pruned) to check;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.10.2017 07:09;0;0;Adding is no less disruptive than removing. Having multiple algorithms is far more complicated (and unsolved) than just using one at a time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.10.2017 06:04;0;0;No, that's trivial for Bitcoin nodes today already, and completely insecure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.10.2017 03:16;0;3;Murdering a human child of any age is always evil. Whether or not you express a preference in saving children is irrelevant to this fact.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 06:09;0;1;So long as the entire community upgrades, it doesn't matter what changes the hardfork includes. Opt-in replay protection would still be good;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 05:41;0;0;No, it doesn't. You can sign messages for any address you receive with, but that doesn't mean you still have any coins previously received.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 05:40;8;22;Replay protection isn't needed for hardforks, just altcoins. Automatic replay protection would be bad for a real hardfork (but opt-in is OK);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 05:39;0;0;The code says 8 MB. It's just obfuscated to confuse people into thinking it's 2 MB.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 05:29;2;17;Hardfork attempts automatically become an altcoin unless 100% of the COMMUNITY (not miners) go along with it. Miners are irrelevant to HFs.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 04:55;1;7;Dunno, their actions to this point are such that we *should* do a PoW change already. No reason to think 2X won't be the last straw alone.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 04:53;0;8;(Also, the final 2 clauses are nonsense, since Bitcoin addresses don't hold coins, and signed messages don't prove ownership.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 04:53;3;27;Uh, that first clause is a get-off-scot-free for Roger already. The NYA specified 2 MB, but 2X is 8 MB. (It's also an altcoin, and not a HF);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 04:48;0;0;Bitcoin doesn't, but society does.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 04:47;0;11;"More or less. It's unfortunate to the few good miners, but we've been far beyond the PoW change should happen"" point before they bought hw.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 04:46;4;9;Indeed, and so is fraud. Many 2X proponents appear to be entering the realm of crime regardless. OTOH, more crime = more jail time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 04:45;0;5;Yes, but that's no problem so long as there is consensus. We've done it before (2013), and can do it again when appropriate.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 04:44;0;2;Link?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 04:44;0;9;Many altcoins have already done so before. There is nothing special about BGold.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 02:27;2;11;Unfortunately, they drag innocent newbies there with their lies, and then brainwash them. Someone has to speak the truth to avoid this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 02:23;4;13;There's no viable PoS algorithm that actually works, at least at this time. PoW change is the answer.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 02:22;1;7;The conspiracy to defraud exists even independently of this attack.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 02:20;4;37;"Not a nightmare. It can be fixed with a simple (yes, simple; ignore the FUD) PoW change.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.10.2017 02:19;4;20;Potentially could render Bitcoin unusable until PoW change, in the worst-case scenario.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.10.2017 06:48;0;2;Didn't even get that far. NDA was mentioned, so I simply said I wouldn't do it under NDA. There's nothing to return if you delete it all.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.10.2017 04:10;0;0;Alternatively, wallets can decide to only support Bitcoin, or even only an altcoin. But playing roulette w/ user money isn't acceptable.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;20.10.2017 04:44;0;5;Not sure what you mean. It only takes one person to replay transactions, so you should assume if it's possible, it will be done.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.10.2017 00:34;2;11;Note that IF the network is as vulnerable as he says, the only thing that logically follows is that we should immediately REDUCE block size.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.10.2017 12:35;0;0;It costs miners nothing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.10.2017 12:25;0;1;Or miners just add fake fees...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.10.2017 11:51;0;2;Miners can fake whatever fees they want. 1 MB minimum is stupid since safe size is 300k. 100k/2wks way too fast. No max = techly impossible;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.10.2017 11:23;0;1;Sounds unreasonable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.10.2017 08:44;0;0;Pretty sure that's already included in the 17%. Anyhow, my point was simply that even 50% would not justify blocks larger than 900k.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.10.2017 08:10;0;0;17% accounts for 300k blocks, so even if it grew at 50%, that'd only be sufficient for ~900k blocks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.10.2017 20:38;0;1;Yes, that's the current plan.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.10.2017 20:15;0;0;BIP44 isn't a very good spec, so unlikely to ever be supported in Core itself. OTOH, no reason for Core to be aware of hw wallet internals..;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.10.2017 19:50;0;3;Core has had HD wallets for several versions now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.10.2017 15:50;0;2;Do you have a lower block size limit? Anyhow, we were talking about Bitcoin, not altcoins...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.10.2017 15:42;0;1;That's a large part of the risk.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.10.2017 15:34;0;1;And failure of the economy to use their own full nodes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.10.2017 15:33;0;7;I'm not. We really need Bitcoin, so IMO focus on just making sure it succeeds despite the challenges.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;18.10.2017 12:58;0;0;I'm just one person.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.10.2017 12:49;0;3;True, but diversity of assets reduces risk;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.10.2017 12:48;0;13;Lightning is coming.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.10.2017 12:47;0;5;I think greenaddress still uses their server for that, and just double checks with your trusted node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.10.2017 12:45;1;10;I do everything I can to try to make Bitcoin a success, but it's certainly not a given.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.10.2017 11:44;1;3;Maybe that'd be true if block sizes were much smaller, but not as-is..;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.10.2017 11:25;5;11;Current centralisation and block sizes leave Bitcoin very vulnerable. Unless things improve, it isn't very likely to survive long term.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;1.10.2017 22:28;11;40;Why do you continue to blatantly lie about 2X being 2 MB? Bitcoin TODAY supports 2-4 MB blocks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.10.2017 22:27;2;19;Yes we are. BIP148 is nothing more than Segwit, just not giving miners a veto on the activation.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;1.10.2017 22:19;0;3;Only because they felt it was too rushed or had too little community support (apparently their local communities were outliers).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.09.2017 22:29;2;34;Bitcoin doesn't work that way. Miners don't define the protocol, period, and there was never a hardfork when Satoshi was around.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.09.2017 06:51;0;11;Sorry, I disagree. A hardfork to reduce the difficulty WITHOUT a PoW change is a stupid idea, and would be very controversial.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 16:10;0;0;That wouldn't change anything. Any random scammer can make a vanity address just as well.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 16:09;1;20;Why do you lie?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 16:07;0;0;I think 7 or so?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 08:31;0;0;There's a small minority that wants 2X. But 2X would be a hardfork, so it needs unanimity, not merely a small minority.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 06:46;0;1;Then why is it not enough to be simply counted as a user?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 05:20;0;0;It isn't an issue except for some tiny minority that isn't satisfied no matter what. 2X will be a complete non-event to Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 05:19;0;0;Softforks don't need consensus. Miners are followers of the rules, not deciders.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 05:18;0;0;The only shenanigans is you making up some meaningless requirement.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 04:39;0;0;Yes, really. At least 60% of users were on-board with BIP148.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 04:38;0;0;But more importantly, the HKA did not guarantee a hardfork. The goal was to make a proposal. The community rejected that proposal.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 04:38;0;0;"Segwit already increased the block size limit to 2-4 MB. There is no such thing as regular size"". The 1 MB limit is gone completely.""";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 04:34;0;1;You don't know what you're talking about. BIP148 was not an attack at all, merely the community un-defering activation to malicious miners.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 04:33;0;3;I DID stand by my words and promises. 2X is 8 MB, not 2 MB. And lacks consensus. Most users oppose 2X.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 04:27;0;2;No, Segwit was already locked-in by BIP148 before 2X was even a thing. NYA is just a hijack attempt.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 04:27;0;1;HKA is done and history now. It also was just with some miners, not users or merchants.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 03:50;0;0;AT&T is DSL only here, no U-verse. And recurring $1k/mo is a lot for internet connectivity... especially only 100/100.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 03:49;0;0;I was about to say Spectrum's cable was 150 Mbps, but they seem to max out at 100 Mbps now... wonder what's going on with that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 03:45;0;0;Working with the business side of Spectrum anyway (the residential side quoted $30k with no per-customer discount back in 2011).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 03:41;0;0;Do they have a fiber service distinct from cable? Should I be aiming for that instead?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 03:37;0;2;Spectrum (formerly Bright House). Their survey came up with $42k minus $5k per customer.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 02:40;0;1;2/ ...but if people want to donate for that express purpose, existing charitable organizations would be a better way than going through me.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 02:16;0;0;My observation is that this group is only about 20%, not most. (Still too many IMO, but not as severe as a majority would be.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 02:15;0;0;Anyone can make a proposal. Even non-developers can crowdfund one.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 01:53;0;0;We have influence, and many people defer to us. That's not quite the same thing as control.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 01:52;0;2;I won't be in financial trouble without it, but I do appreciate the gratitude and support.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 01:29;0;0;That's not for me to disclose.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 00:58;14;148;Says the guy who's trying to damage both its scarcity and usefulness...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 00:55;3;15;People who are going to donate should do so because they support my work, not because I'm poor (I'm not). (But I'm not millions-rich either);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 00:53;0;2;Those blocks were mined by Eligius (which has always had zero fees, if you recall). The miners on the pool obviously received the bitcoins.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 00:48;0;2;Maybe. OTOH, one should not trust Twitter to verify me either - or Twitter could impersonate me...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 00:27;30;66;If you're interested in donating to me, please be careful not to donate to the scam address(es) in cloned posts! http://luke.dashjr.org/tmp/verify/20170923-Irma-address.txt …https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/911716403086073858 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.09.2017 00:16;0;2;Many devs aren't in the USA...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 22:54;0;2;That's very expensive, sadly. But it makes sense as a stretch goal, since that would improve my resilience to prolonged power outages.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 22:26;0;1;10 BTC per child per year? That's an expensive private school...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 21:50;0;3;The donations are certainly more than just a few bucks, although I agree it's a shame scammers can raise millions so easily.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 21:21;0;0;Bitcoin Core should not have control. Better decentralisation of development is welcome.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 21:15;0;1;Where is this FUD coming from? BIP23 does no such thing. Part of our problem today is that miners *aren't using* BIP23 anymore.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 21:13;0;1;(If you do, then perhaps sell the litecoins and donate them as bitcoins?);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 21:13;0;1;I can generate Litecoin addresses, but that just takes the coins off the market - I don't consider it ethical to actually sell/use litecoins;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 21:12;0;2;It's a reasonable stretch goal: I realised with Irma, that DSL won't survive power outages even if my generator does. Cable would fix that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 21:11;1;2;Hey, you wrote the script... complimenting yourself? :p;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 21:09;0;0;Because we have observed that even 1 MB is dangerous, and have too little data on how much worse the recent bump to 2-4 MB will be.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 20:39;0;0;You have it backward. It's mining nodes that are irrelevant for protocol changes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 20:37;0;6;I'm not the one ignoring users and merchants.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 20:27;0;2;It would only be an upgrade if EVERYONE consented. Most people don't. With only partial consent, it can only become an altcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 20:24;0;0;"1/ Everybody adopted the 2013 hardfork; 2/ Overflow bug was fixed with softfork; 3/ Pieter fixed the 2140-50BTC-again bug, w/ softfork.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 13:37;0;0;Sure, but I doubt civil fraud will break the corporate veil.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 13:36;2;14;200 minutes is less than 4 hours. No big deal.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 13:12;1;17;Except it doesn't. And PoW doesn't NEED to be changed even if that were true.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 12:54;0;3;The corporations obviously are liable. I'm wondering when that liability becomes personal for their CEOs.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 12:54;9;54;Bitcoin can survive as long as users want it to. Most users oppose 2X, and anyone can mine. Larger blocks won't be needed for years.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 12:53;0;2;LOL Did a lawyer actually tell you that?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 12:41;5;17;Prosecution of fraud doesn't depend on trademarks. Totally different areas of law. Trademarks are civil. Fraud is criminal.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 12:39;1;4;Anyone can make an altcoin at any time. It's the passing it off as Bitcoin that's fraud.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 12:38;5;26;No, it doesn't work that way. 2X is an altcoin. It can't wipe anything Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 11:15;35;190;I wonder at what point CEOs become *personally* liable for fraudulently passing off altcoins (like 2X) as bitcoins.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 11:03;2;6;Having a backdoor in the first place is a serious problem IMO.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.09.2017 06:38;0;2;It's a difficult decision for me as well. (Mainly because of the high cost.);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;22.09.2017 06:18;0;2;UASF locked in Segwit before 2X was ever a thing. It's just trying to ride on Segwit's success.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.09.2017 06:17;0;1;Peercoin's PoS is not secure. I don't see how PoS would change the spam/fee situation at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.09.2017 04:13;0;0;Right, point is that HKA wasn't about changing that. It was not aiming to be a block size hardfork, merely rebalanced old txs as one change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.09.2017 03:57;0;1;I will be watching with interest for Bitcoin. I don't think anyone's come up with a workable PoS scheme, but if so, maybe it's the way to go;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.09.2017 03:56;0;0;Segwit blocks are up to 4 MB. The point is HKA wouldn't change that, just make it available to old transactions.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.09.2017 01:42;0;2;In general, assume you can't remove a wallet from a system.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.09.2017 01:41;0;0;Segwit is already 2 MB blocks. The proposed HF would simply make all the space usable for non-Segwit as well.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.09.2017 01:03;0;5;We have Segwit only because the users used a UASF to activate it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.09.2017 01:01;0;0;HKA did not call for larger blocks, only a HF to extend the new block space to non-segwit txs.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.09.2017 00:33;0;1;HKA was 2 MB, not 8 MB like 2X.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.09.2017 00:26;0;0;For every tweet?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;22.09.2017 00:25;0;1;Mostly the liking his own tweets. Red flag for a troll IMO.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 23:41;0;0;Yet it didn't happen when colluding miners blocked Segwit.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 23:40;0;1;2X proponents aren't every TRYING to convince people to support their proposal. If it fails due to lack of adoption, that is why.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 23:22;0;8;If you want to trust, you don't need mining. So distrusting miners is only to be expected.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 22:57;0;0;But the pre-x86 one is likely compiled from the same source code (more or less), and it's just a matter of adapting the exploit code.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 22:51;0;5;Do regular nodes use a pre-defined checkpoint (like most Bitcoin full nodes), or implicitly trust the history beyond some point?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 22:45;0;0;By fooling you into thinking you received coins you didn't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 22:37;0;0;I doubt it will be the last incident either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 22:26;0;0;No, now you're just trusting http://blockchain.info .;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 22:26;0;0;An attacker can make you think you received confirmed payment(s), when you really didn't. (If you don't care, =you don't need a blockchain.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 22:25;1;4;If your full node or wallet run on an affected system, you may have your bitcoins stolen by an attacker. (Maybe even if the PC is off.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 22:24;0;1;... and then full nodes won't see the later alertable blocks at all (and won't make the alert).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 22:23;0;0;Otherwise, someone will just make an invalid block using an un-alertable scenario...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 22:22;0;0;Unfortunately, one fraud alert is only useful in a niche attack scenario. To make light clients secure, ALL scenarios must have fraud alerts;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 22:21;0;1;There are over 100k full nodes on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin can only work if MOST users run their own node. https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/security.html …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 22:19;0;0;No, it isn't. Sybil is a thing. And it's critical that miners aren't trusted either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 22:17;0;3;"That's how I define SPV"" ";;;;;;https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/910961301689655296;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 22:17;0;4;It says Skylake (2015) and newer, but it's not unlikely to affect systems as old as Core2 (2006). I expect AMD procs to have a similar vuln.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 22:05;0;2;SPV is impossible. Light clients are not much better than exchanges - you've simply replaced a known entity with random unknown nodes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 21:34;0;2;Small blocks make it (gradually, over time) easier for users to run their own full node.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 21:23;0;6;No. Ethereum has ONLY miners running full nodes. That's basically the same as the Fed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 21:22;0;1;Or I am well aware that it can't do better faster. :);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 21:04;0;2;Bitcoin cannot function in such a scenario as you describe. If Bitcoin is already failing, we should reduce block size to make it viable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 21:01;0;0;There are serious known issues with even 1 MB blocks: full node percentage vs users is dangerously low because the blockchain is too big.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 06:13;1;5;What?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 00:37;0;2;That just means you're STILL an ignoramus.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.09.2017 00:33;0;2;Are you trying to imply it's my fault you've been ignorant of Bitcoin's capabilities for so long?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 21:58;0;3;Google Translate says you're misrepresenting what it actually says...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 20:11;0;1;That Bitcoin survives is more important than what the fees are. I'd like fees to be low, but not at the expense of Bitcoin's long-term.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 20:00;0;0;I don't, and it doesn't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 12:59;0;2;Sure, I was just talking about the technical side. Discussions can include anyone.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 12:45;0;0;It's a good idea to ensure people don't *accidentally* forget to upgrade a node, but it doesn't change the requirements for a hardfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 12:44;0;0;"Only with consensus. Without consensus, users will just reject the forced upgrade, and upgrade"" to the same code (minus the lockout).""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 12:43;0;3;Just users, really. Devs only matter when users run their code. Miners just serve the users as well.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 12:31;0;0;2X can't be deserted if it's never adopted...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 12:31;0;0;The block size limit is already 2+ MB anyway. And we don't need increases right now, we need a decrease.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 12:30;0;1;Bitcoin Knots releases self-expire after 1-2 years unless the user overrides it. But you can't force upgrades, only remind the user.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 12:11;1;29;1/Miners have already misbehaved, or UASF wouldn't've been needed. 2/Developers aren't in a special position to decide more than other users;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 06:15;0;1;I think @ jtimon linked you a wiki page all about them above.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 06:13;0;1;Due to the malleability bug, it wouldn't have been secure in 2009. But that's irrelevant - back then, there were many bugs. Bugs get fixed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 06:05;0;1;Segwit wasn't a hardfork. I'm not sure what you're asking now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 06:00;0;1;Segwit is a bugfix. Everything it enabled, was designed/intended to be possible from the start.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 05:50;0;0;Bishop Thuc formally declared JP2 a heretic in 1982.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 05:30;0;0;By your logic, every single softfork splits the chain unless every single node (including light clients!) upgrades to the enforcing fullnode;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 05:26;0;0;That's no different than saying a P2SH-violating chain isn't invalid. Or that an 8 MB block chain isn't invalid.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 05:01;0;0;Not necessarily. That would only happen if *miners* split the chain by making a longer invalid chain that your [non-full] node accepted.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 03:31;0;0;N/a;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 03:30;0;0;A proposal is contentious if people oppose it for good reason, even if they don't run nodes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 03:29;0;0;No, it couldn't. Miners could have caused a split in retaliation, but they can do that with or without softforks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 01:22;0;2;Because it's not useful.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.09.2017 01:10;0;3;What? Of course they can. Sidechains can do literally anything that could be done in an altcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 23:01;0;0;I know I want them to be as cheap as possible, and I expect other devs are the same. We don't even get the fees! But gotta be realistic.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 21:54;0;1;Miners can split the chain at any time by mining invalid blocks, with or without UASFs. UASF doesn't change this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 21:14;0;0;UASF doesn't split the chain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 20:46;0;1;UASF wasn't/isn't a threat.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 20:45;0;0;No, a majority of the community supported BIP148, and if the blindly-follow-Core group was onboard, it would have matched Segwit support.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 20:43;0;2;That's a lie.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 20:01;0;6;Yes, on-chain. (Although your dismissal of other Bitcoin layers is ridiculous.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 19:20;0;0;There wouldn't even BE a legacy chain unless miners performed a chain-split attack. Note this is the same as with any softfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 19:06;0;1;Without mandatory signalling, there is uncertainty around what the chain rules are, and light clients cannot make a decision on which rules.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 19:05;0;4;But nobody was objecting to it on those grounds.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 19:04;2;4;Probably around half of all softforks were contentious. Not tolerating contentious softforks would probably mean no more softforks ever.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 19:02;1;8;I agree, but people are trying to spread misinformation to make it sound like Core opposed it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 19:02;1;2;All future softforks should be like BIP148.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 19:00;0;1;Contentious changes are fine if have sufficient support and do no harm to those who don't opt to use them. Segwit itself was contentious.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 18:37;0;5;It's just the truth.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 18:36;1;4;And even without that 20%, the other 60% who made an informed decision to support BIP148 was sufficient for its success.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 18:33;0;6;The ONLY significant hold-backs for BIP148, were people blindly following Core to make the decisions for them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 18:24;11;37;Bitcoin has supported smart contracts since 2009.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 18:20;0;6;It's not a false narrative. Almost all the categories on the page are supportive of BIP148.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 18:15;1;4;Please don't quote me out of context.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 18:14;0;1;Of course, because it is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 18:08;4;40;No, it wasn't. UASF was in the spirit of how Bitcoin is intended to work. 2X is a complete violation of that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 18:07;0;3;You mean a chain split. That's not a HF...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 08:59;2;13;Matt and Morcos were part of the non-supportive minority. Majority of devs supported BIP148.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 06:07;0;4;Context matters. UASF didn't cause a chain split. BCH is just an unrelated altcoin - nothing to do with UASF.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 04:56;0;11;You're assuming some altcoin can do better faster. The last 8 years shows that altcoins do nothing but copy, while innovation is on Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 03:49;4;21;No, it didn't. BIP148 had widespread support, and most devs supported it. Just not ALL devs, because a few were too pessimistic.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 03:48;0;1;It had a different limit (database locks) that made even 1 MB blocks impossible.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 03:47;0;0;Because anything larger is unsustainable (at least for now).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 01:36;0;0;Except your soft fork doesn't have widespread user support. It's also unclear whether it harms those who don't want it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 01:35;0;3;The uncensored ones have more readers anyway.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 01:02;0;10;No, it wasn't. Besides (really) scaling, there is also the huge issues of user experience/interface, and security.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 00:57;0;0;Existing rules included BIP148.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 00:35;0;0;Neither chain is traded at that price...?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 00:33;0;0;You don't get it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 00:24;0;0;Actually, we'd have been able to give the same discount to non-segwit transactions in that case, so I'm not sure it would be...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 00:24;0;0;Just to be clear, which chain is it?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 00:19;0;0;Not increasing it would have probably been better, though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 00:18;0;3;Same here. Who doesn't consider ETC the real Eth?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 00:16;0;0;93% *don't* support 2X - only 5-12%. And for a hardfork change, it needs 100% (or at least pretty close), not merely 93%.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 00:13;0;0;2X proposes fraud to force people to abandon Bitcoin. UASF hurt nobody, and merely improved Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 00:11;1;2;People in civilized countries should expect prosecution of widespread fraud.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 00:09;0;12;BCH already accomplished the clean(ish) split.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 00:08;0;0;All Bitcoin implementations treat 2X as invalid, since there is a 4M weight limit, and 2X produces invalid blocks with >4M weight.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 00:06;0;0;No, it's the attempted hardfork *removing* the UASF that would cause a persistent chain split. The UASF itself does not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;19.09.2017 00:01;0;0;"The two extremes"" are smaller and safer block sizes, or larger block sizes. The middle road is to not change it.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 23:59;0;0;Because the users of Bitcoin don't collectively recognise it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 23:59;0;0;No, Bitcoin is the consensus code/rules that the network (collective of users who run nodes) runs. Core is one implementation of that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 23:58;0;0;Unlikely.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 23:55;0;1;Coinbase and other businesses will learn the hard way if they try to steal their customers' money through fraud.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 23:54;1;11;The whitepaper was just an overview at best. Satoshi's actual code ALWAYS enforced the rules, whether mining or not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 23:53;0;8;But it's also completely centralised.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 23:51;0;0;Every softfork has a hypothetical opposing hardfork removing the new rule. But it is only the hardfork (not the softfork) which can split.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 23:50;0;9;Anyone can mine. If the miners go away, it gets easier for everyone else to become the new miners.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 23:49;0;0;If that's *all* you do, then no, you don't. Maybe you should be heard out anyway, but the reality is you're not a user in that case.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 23:48;0;11;Also, producing invalid blocks is ZERO hashpower as far as Bitcoin is concerned.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 23:48;0;27;Hashpower is miners. Miners don't decide the protocol, period. That 90% is meaningless.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 23:47;0;9;No, it would not. Maybe miners would have split the chain to retaliate, but that's on them. Blaming BIP148 would be a lie.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 23:45;0;0;"BCH and 2X are altcoins with different rules than Bitcoin. Their blocks are seen as invalid to Bitcoin nodes, no matter how much work"".""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 22:15;0;1;No, they won't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 22:12;0;0;I don't think COOP was 6 months? And what lack? Nobody is trying to push it without consensus...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 20:40;0;0;Of course not, why should we abandon the brand just because some altcoin becomes popular?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 20:33;1;4;Sorry, I blocked him.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 20:32;0;5;Why would we abandon a brand to a fraud with like 5% support?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 19:34;1;16;The majority DID support it, just not unanimous. But UASF doesn't split the chain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 19:13;4;61;Nobody threatened a chain split except bitmain. Soft forks don't split the chain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 18:19;0;12;Ignoring this is like governments trying to legislate mathematics, like defining pi=3;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 18:16;0;1;It was also for a hard fork, not an altcoin (which 2X has become).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 18:15;0;1;The agreement was only for 2 megabytes anyway. Not 8 megabytes, as 2X proposes...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 18:12;0;0;If you don't run a full node, you don't use Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 18:10;0;0;I could have gone with the COOP proposal...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 18:06;1;7;Reality is an issue. No matter what documents say, protocol rules are necessarily what nodes enforce.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 05:51;3;53;I didn't say that. Bitcoin would have a better chance of succeeding if adoption took place AFTER it becomes ready for mainstream use.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;18.09.2017 03:23;0;1;Most alts have almost identical code to Bitcoin. That's irrelevant. (I think Litecoin might actually be closer to Bitcoin than BCH.);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.09.2017 02:35;0;1;That's pure FUD.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.09.2017 02:35;0;0;Partly due to this problem, which is hopefully now solved.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.09.2017 02:30;0;5;If you had any objections, the time to do that was when BIP 2 was proposed, not nearly a year after it was accepted.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.09.2017 02:29;1;2;While the IETF may in some way provide good examples for us, Bitcoin and BIPs are not the IETF.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.09.2017 02:25;0;1;Core has never agreed to anything, and has nothing to back out from.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.09.2017 02:24;0;1;BCH is not a hardfork, it is an altcoin. A hardfork would be changing Bitcoin itself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.09.2017 02:23;0;1;Miners aren't gatekeepers. They didn't allow segwit. The community bypassed them and activated it with BIP148.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.09.2017 01:48;0;1;HKA was about making a hardfork proposal. That's ancient history by now. The community rejected the proposal. (also irrelevant to my point);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;31.08.2017 23:17;0;1;Nope, there were no issues. What is it you hope to accomplish with this FUD?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;31.08.2017 19:43;1;11;Actually, we're up to 28% support for 300k blocks. Still not enough, admittedly, but once Lightning goes production I hope to see a jump.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.08.2017 19:27;3;15;If you can't run your own node, work toward a block size decrease. Trusting just defeats the point of Bitcoin entirely. Just use PayPal...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.08.2017 19:25;3;18;Max theoretical is 4 MB. 2 MB is the typical expected size, that can be realised as soon as people choose to.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.08.2017 04:53;0;8;I actually predicted that there would be no meaningful impact to fees. But it's too early to call anything yet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.08.2017 04:52;0;2;It compromises your own security (you rely on & trust the State and lawsuits, rather than the blockchain), and by proxy, the Bitcoin economy;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.08.2017 20:49;0;1;What nonsense are you spreading here? Spy-mining wasn't invented until long after BIP 23, which has nothing to do with it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.08.2017 05:31;4;46;They have fundamentally the same design. The difference between an altcoin and a hardfork is whether it has consensus. Neither BCH nor 2X do;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.08.2017 05:29;0;2;"Obviously to try to hijack the expectations of BIP148 activating then. Just like they try to hijack the name Bitcoin"" even to today.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.08.2017 05:28;0;0;BCH and 2X altcoins have NOTHING to do with UASF at all. BIP148 was a complete success.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.08.2017 05:26;0;4;UASF was a softfork. Softforks don't create hardforks, by definition.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.08.2017 22:56;0;16;2X is an altcoin at most. It has nothing to do with Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.08.2017 22:43;0;3;I would have considered helping them if they didn't insist on hijacking the Bitcoin name. (Heck, I might even help BCH if they stopped.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.08.2017 22:39;0;2;No, they are both altcoins, and unrelated to Bitcoin. (A hardfork would be when Bitcoin itself changes.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.08.2017 22:39;0;3;Looks like just Bitcoin with a PoW change (and ICO inflation? not entirely clear). Since it lacks consensus, it's really a premined altcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.08.2017 22:36;1;28;Nothing is scheduled for Bitcoin in November.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.08.2017 21:55;3;53;There's no HF scheduled for Bitcoin, so that shouldn't be a problem.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.08.2017 21:41;1;3;"Bitcoin Knots will obviously stick to Bitcoin. Never supported any altcoins before; no reason to start with 2X.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.08.2017 21:01;0;1;My point is that they don't need to reflect the entire community, in order to confirm the certain failure of a hardfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.08.2017 20:55;0;0;This is because hardforks require consensus from the entire community to be successful, and 63% in a part of the community impedes that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.08.2017 20:54;0;1;I didn't say that. But 63% on Twitter opposing a hardfork is guaranteed failure for the hardfork, even if that 63% isn't perfectly accurate.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.08.2017 23:23;0;2;Or responding to a joke poll with a joke answer. I hope.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.08.2017 07:16;0;2;Miner signalling is completely meaningless for this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.08.2017 06:57;0;1;NYA is 4-8 MB, not 2 MB!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.08.2017 06:06;0;1;Maybe, but if so, it's very non-obvious how to do it without it being very vulnerable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.08.2017 05:59;0;17;... I guess that'd be one way to do a hardfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.08.2017 05:40;1;3;Nothing comes out of thin air. Most likely Bitcoin's value would be the sum of all altcoins higher, if those altcoins didn't exist.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.08.2017 03:38;0;3;Twitter has stupid short length limits for poll answers.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.08.2017 01:21;0;0;Too complicated for Twitter. I suggest Bishop Sanborn's Q&A: http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/SSPX_QA_RevPDF2.pdf …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.08.2017 01:20;0;8;OTOH, my polls on BCash pretty accurately predicted what ended up happening...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.08.2017 00:56;0;6;It is. Everyone voting is a human being, same species as me.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.08.2017 00:55;0;4;But Twitter polls can actually give an indication of what really matters (user consent).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.08.2017 00:54;0;3;I'm on the other list.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;27.08.2017 19:06;5;25;Miners and their hash power are irrelevant to hardfork attempts.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.08.2017 21:30;0;3;Anything can signal that wants to signal. All such signals (including blocks mined) are entirely meaningless when it comes to hardforks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2017 21:25;0;16;Not to mention, if you made it up, nobody can call you out on it now, because you didn't name someone specific.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2017 21:25;1;31;But if you don't, everyone is left speculating and you effectively falsely accuse every other developer.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2017 19:48;2;6;Flag-day change of PoW algorithm.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2017 19:26;0;0;Yes. Having two PoW algorithms active at the same time is a lot more complicated that it seems at face value.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2017 05:08;1;2;Polling the community through multiple methods. When it all shows the same result, it seems pretty reasonably solid.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2017 05:07;0;8;That's a myth. I've asked for evidence and investigated claims many times, and nobody has been able to come up with anything.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2017 04:19;0;4;It's not giving up at all, merely fixing a bug that has developed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2017 03:15;1;3;Obviously when you come under attack, the proper response is to defend yourself and resist. Not to just give in to the attacker's demands.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2017 03:15;1;7;"Protecting the network from attacks is desperate""? What else are we supposed to do? Just throw up our hands and give up?""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2017 03:14;0;5;Nonsense, we had BIP148 before NYA, and it was BIP148 that succeeded in the end.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2017 02:45;0;3;That happens normally anyway. It's also a VERY known risk they took by buying miners when the situation was so far beyond time for a change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2017 02:35;4;42;Why does the vast majority of the community support Core? Why does only 37% consent to 2X, and even 25% of that only if everyone else does?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2017 02:04;1;3;PoW change is just a hardfork, like any other hardfork. It becomes an altcoin only if it fails to get consensus.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;26.08.2017 02:02;0;1;Staged deployment of a PoW change is risky.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.08.2017 02:02;0;0;SHA2 is no longer providing security, just a threat. Changing PoW would IMPROVE security.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.08.2017 22:09;0;1;Signed emails would expose the whistleblower, unfortunately.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.08.2017 20:04;0;0;1/ That's not possible, 2/ Making full blocks at this point would be malicious.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.08.2017 12:07;0;10;Satellites are no substitute for p2p.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.08.2017 11:52;1;1;People aren't supposed to *remember* passwords for websites... That's what password managers are for.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.08.2017 11:46;0;1;No, Tonal is base 8*2.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.08.2017 08:34;0;3;Maybe. My goal is to make people aware that this option exists. Not everyone will take it. (But I will do my part.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.08.2017 08:31;0;1;Then you're not running a full node at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.08.2017 08:31;0;1;What? Softforks don't need consensus, only hardforks do. And none of these things are possible as softforks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.08.2017 07:15;0;0;Not really. It just makes not-downloading those signatures easier.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.08.2017 07:14;0;15;Because loss of hashrate isn't the primary problem. Monopoly over the PoW algorithm is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.08.2017 05:19;1;7;"It's wrong with networks"". There is one Lightning network, and it is a p2p network.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.08.2017 05:16;0;2;I didn't say you shouldn't use it. Only that it is better for Bitcoin if you *only* use it *when you actually need it*.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.08.2017 05:05;0;2;Mass adoption has bigger hurdles to overcome than block sizes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.08.2017 05:04;0;4;It really doesn't. The blocks are only filled by spam, and spam expands to fill any size. Just bid higher on the fee. Not ideal, admittedly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.08.2017 02:36;0;4;If you need it, you need it. But when you don't need it, you have freedom to choose: lower fees, or long-term Bitcoin health?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.08.2017 01:56;0;0;MAST is not supported on Bitcoin yet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.08.2017 00:55;0;4;The former. We can't get it below 1 MB, but if 50% of transactions stick to non-Segwit, we can pull the average down to 1.5 MB instead of 2;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.08.2017 23:33;1;10;Also the next chance to deploy Segwit wouldn't be for years, giving altcoins a huge chance to get ahead of Bitcoin w/ Lightning.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.08.2017 23:33;0;11;On principle. The community clearly wanted/wants Segwit, and the miners were maliciously blocking it. Plus it's a fix we need eventually.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.08.2017 21:47;0;0;Segwit doesn't make pruning any easier or harder.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.08.2017 21:45;0;1;Yes, up to 4 MB. But storage isn't really an issue since you can just prune.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.08.2017 19:33;0;5;Net result: to accept your transaction, miners must produce a slightly smaller block. With enough users, this can add up.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.08.2017 19:33;1;7;By using non-Segwit transactions, your transactions will weigh more, and hit the new weight limit sooner, while the tx size is the same.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.08.2017 19:32;4;10;Segwit replaces the block size limit with a block weight limit. Segwit transactions use less weight, which is how >1 MB blocks can be made.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.08.2017 19:26;0;0;Which part?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.08.2017 19:13;4;37;Note using non-Segwit txs DOES mean you'll lose out on SOME of Segwit's fee reduction. But I care more about the long-term than short-term.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.08.2017 18:57;22;89;PSA: If you support reducing the block size (good for Bitcoin), avoid using Segwit for normal transactions. Only use Segwit for Lightning.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.08.2017 18:07;0;0;No point. The blockchain provides basically nothing of use for this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.08.2017 18:00;0;0;(and attempts to use it as one are an attack you can expect the network to resist and make unfeasible);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.08.2017 17:59;0;0;Doesn't make sense. The blockchain is not a backup or data storage system.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.08.2017 00:28;0;23;At this rate I'll be as late as segwithttps://glympse.com/0E5T-532D;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 23:00;0;0;The long term doesn't matter if we can't survive that long. But in any case, this plan fits the long term best.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 21:05;0;1;It's not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 21:04;0;1;What do you mean? Trans. use today is only maybe ~700k, but spammers fill the blocks up anyway.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 21:03;0;0;So speed-fill the blockchain until Bitcoin requires 1.2 TB bandwidth and ~nobody can use it anymore, then cement in that un-usability?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 18:25;33;196;Add more miners switch to bcash, it becomes less profitable. So long as the market stands strong on Bitcoin, it will prevail in the end.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 16:55;0;0;2/ Even 1 MB is 30-50% increase per year. Technology only improves enough for 17%/year. Soonish, nobody will be able to use Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 16:55;0;4;1/ Block size is the rate at which the blockchain grows. Blockchain size is what determines cost to use Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 16:38;0;3;Segwit is already activating 2+ MB blocks in a few days. 2X is 8 MB.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 16:30;0;1;With enough community support, it could. Unfortunately, it looks like we still need a lot more education to get to that point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 16:14;0;2;Nowhere near. Best-case scenario for NYA only has 20-25% support.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 16:13;1;5;In other words, with 1 MB blocks, the blockchain will outpace technology and soonish nobody will be able to use Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 16:12;0;2;1 MB blocks are 52 GB/year, or 35% (52% compared to not long ago). Technological improvements are only 17%/year.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 16:10;0;1;Computer improvements is where part of that 17%/year comes from.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 07:24;0;1;Except I can't, because it still isn't an option with Twitter polls.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 04:15;0;0;You say that as if the community supports the NYA, or as if Core decides protocol changes. Neither are true.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 04:13;0;0;Personally, I agree it's a good idea for miners to altruistically set a reasonable soft limit on their own, even if we keep the higher limit;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 04:12;0;0;For the purposes of the poll, assume at least/most 3 months (least/most depending on whichever you'd be more inclined to consent to).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 02:45;0;1;Even if you trust the data, it still must be processed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 01:52;0;3;There's no reasonable hope to overcome it more than 17%/year at best. Wanting something doesn't magically turn into it happening.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 01:51;0;1;All the more reason to make sure ARM processors can keep up.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 01:48;0;3;Big blocks is playing with fire... not keeping them at a safe size.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 01:47;0;0;How do you verify that chip isn't backdoored?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 01:47;0;0;How you get the data is not so important if it takes a year to process that data.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 01:36;0;3;Note that if you can't use Bitcoin, then you can't use Lightning either... And what makes you think bigger blocks = better??;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 01:32;0;0;At least 3 months?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 01:31;0;3;What do you even mean? It already is...?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 01:31;0;2;Maybe a MimbleWimble extension block could be exempt from size limits. That doesn't help the current blockchain, however.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 01:27;0;2;Pruning doesn't help where the bottlenecks are.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 01:26;0;2;Trusting that the signatures in past blocks are valid. Which has been done since 2010 (v0.3.2), so it's already factored into this.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 01:24;0;4;But you DON'T just trust the wallet. You audit it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 01:22;0;0;Also, checkpoints don't actually help much. They're already factored into this, too!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 01:21;0;3;You can audit the node and wallet code. The only way to audit the checkpoint is to actually sync properly.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 01:20;0;3;You can't solve it, merely improve it. And that's only 17% per year or so, which allows us 300-500k blocks...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 01:19;0;12;So if a decade from now, it takes a full year to start using Bitcoin, that's okay with you?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 01:18;1;2;Well, that's someone who doesn't WANT to learn. Hopefully most people DO want to learn.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 01:04;0;0;Education has been improving in general over the last few years. This initial poll is just to see how much more is needed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 00:59;0;9;(Original math was based on 100G blockchain size... it's growing too fast recently! );;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 00:58;0;8;"It's not an extreme claim, just simple math. Blockchain is ~150G; processing improves about 17%/year = max growth 25G/year = 475k/block";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 00:56;0;5;Maybe it could be based on recent block sizes and/or times? So if 50% of the hashrate defects, blocks can be 2x larger to accommodate...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 00:48;1;10;Reduce the damage being irreversibly done to Bitcoin by blocks being too large. Merely maintaining the current level of damage needs <=300k;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;21.08.2017 00:43;20;23;Would you support a softfork to *temporarily* reduce the # Bitcoin block size?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.08.2017 22:40;0;16;Nope. The user community and developer community are both very inclusive, despite their lies that we aren't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.08.2017 22:36;1;11;Those who defect to an altcoin are obviously no longer part of the Bitcoin community.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.08.2017 22:33;0;14;Good luck to exchanges that betray the entire community.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.08.2017 19:06;0;1;Maybe God gave us Bitcoin by fabricating the character of Nakamoto out of thin air, and disappearing him before anyone realised it?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.08.2017 18:47;2;16;Oppose the Bitcoin community, you mean. At that point, it's up to the community to get more miners going - something we CAN'T do w/ SHA2.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.08.2017 06:27;1;4;Block size increases are just a distraction. Lightning is what makes the real improvement, and Segwit enables that.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;20.08.2017 02:27;0;1;Almost nobody agreed to it, and most oppose it. Segwit activated by itself via BIP148. 2X is just trying to ride on the coattails.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;20.08.2017 02:07;0;1;There is no 1 MB block size limit anymore...;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 16:04;0;1;Preferably plan to have it a day before the actual activation (or a few days after), just in case of unexpected issues.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 15:58;0;0;Anyone can solve blocks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 15:57;0;0;"Will there be a Segwit activation part in a few weeks? ;) (Are there more than ~5 people at meetups yet?)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 15:51;2;11;Miners are less than 1% of the community, and any part they represent of the community is independent of their role as miners.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 15:30;0;4;Maybe TREZOR should add a unique identifier...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 15:26;0;5;Miners are not the community. Join some discussion groups where Bitcoin users actually talk...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 15:18;4;33;UASF isn't a hardfork, and had wide community support, which is why it succeeded.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 15:14;1;10;Is this a joke? Almost nobody seems to support Segwit2x...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 15:04;0;8;(As for coming up with such a way, that's an ongoing problem that should be solved by the proponents of said hardfork.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 15:03;1;15;We don't need a more definitive way until there's ambiguity about whether it has consensus or not. So far, it's obvious that it is lacking.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 14:52;2;26;No, hashpower is irrelevant to hardforks. Especially by the code, which just treats any hardfork attempts (even w/ consensus) as an attack.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 14:20;53;231;Hardforks CANNOT be dictated. They can only succeed with REAL consensus from the community.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 14:20;64;273;The #1 reason # Segwit2x will fail is that its proponents choose to ignore the community rather than seek actual consensus.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 02:00;1;13;No, BIP148 is still active and not going anywhere.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 01:49;2;8;UASF being on the table was months ago. At this point, UASF is fully activated, and not going anywhere.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 01:34;0;6;So? Even if they abandon Bitcoin, Bitcoin will remain the same.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 01:08;3;12;BIP148 requires that since August 1st, to be a Bitcoin miner, they must signal the Segwit bit. Once Segwit activates, Segwit must be enforcd;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 00:59;0;17;Only if the community lets them... They have no real power.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.08.2017 00:59;2;16;"Indeed. I'm hoping now that we're past miners holding Bitcoin hostage, perhaps we'll get to $10k this year after all? ;)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.08.2017 19:22;7;73;Don't call it too early. Segwit hasn't activated yet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.08.2017 18:18;8;72;Congrats the entire community. :);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2017 12:13;0;0;Sweeping complex hierarchies is not practical.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2017 12:00;0;1;Wallets want to support new and innovative features. A fixed standard impedes this to some extent.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.08.2017 09:38;0;2;This was discussed at the S3ND meeting earlier this year, and the general conclusion was that interchangeability was unfeasible at this time;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.08.2017 15:17;6;23;Bitcoin never dies until the community stops using it. If we need to, we can do a hardfork with consensus.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2017 18:46;0;0;Why do you need an extkey? I want to dump my pre-hd wallets;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;3.08.2017 04:33;0;3;Bitcoin can be both;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2017 04:06;0;2;I disagree.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2017 03:08;0;1;A new altcoin gave Coinbase some premine. They have no obligation to access nor share it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;3.08.2017 03:08;0;6;That's a totally absurd comparison. The situation is NOTHING like a stock split.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.08.2017 18:01;1;15;Consensus systems don't run on specs. Actual code is all that matters.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.08.2017 04:31;2;13;And you didn't say anything until now? Why didn't you let everyone know there was an issue on the spot???;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.08.2017 04:13;5;25;Disclaimer: I'm not 100% sure either way. BCash's code is review-resistant. :\;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.08.2017 04:02;9;23;I missed the important bit. Thanks @ NicolasDorier for pointing it out. BCash's replay protection does indeed seem to be two-way.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.08.2017 03:39;1;4;No, it wasn't. It's true that a majority of miners can perform a chain split attack at any time, but in that case we can just PoW change.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;31.07.2017 04:42;0;0;I disagree that this is a softfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.07.2017 04:42;0;2;It probably makes sense to consider a HF, but not this one and not this quickly... PoW change would make sense.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.07.2017 04:41;0;2;4 hours between blocks isn't that abnormal, and miners choose block times, so it'd be easy to game.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.07.2017 03:05;0;20;BMC lacks Segwit, so not quite the same thing...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.07.2017 02:57;0;4;That'd be a hardfork...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.07.2017 02:55;0;0;It's a bit long to say, maybe? Ask the ones who aren't using it...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.07.2017 15:02;0;17;Possible countermeasures are mostly UASFs and PoW changes. I won't give them ideas on attacks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.07.2017 09:10;5;35;I disagree there is a valid rationale for any miner-controlled coin, or for an anti-scaling coin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.07.2017 08:14;0;10;Pretty much not, right. The current Ethereum was an altcoin relative to ETC.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.07.2017 07:39;2;21;No. A hardfork means the original chain is abandoned by everyone.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.07.2017 15:50;0;4;Indeed, it would be ideal if exchanges were polling customers directly. Although some way to coordinate the questions would be useful..;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 15:37;0;4;Heck, even a block size hardfork might have been completed by now if things went that way. Hindsight is always clearer.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 15:36;0;1;Smart investors will hire someone skilled they trust to verify things. Your decision not to doesn't centralise development, in any case.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 14:15;0;8;Reducing the block weight limit would be just another softfork on top. The hard part will be establishing support for it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 12:26;1;8;BIP 91 is dangerous without Segwit2x attached. It's merely the same as BIP148, but on Jihan's terms.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 11:10;0;0;Except your GF has no business making rules for you. Miners, on the other hand, are DEFINED by the rules the community decides on.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 10:52;0;1;BIP148 doesn't do that. It just requires that valid blocks must have a single bit set in the header.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 10:45;0;1;No, UASF is a softfork. Softforks are never hardforks. Also, BIP148 does not split the chain.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 09:36;4;30;You mean the agreement that a miner broke within less than a week, and developers fulfilled their end anyway? How is that relevant at all?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 09:32;0;6;What do you mean? Segwit2x is 8 MB, and the only fix is to just not do it.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 09:27;3;27;It's not a reason, it's insanity or trolling. There is no rational basis for opposing Segwit.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 09:26;0;3;That's Segwit2x.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 09:23;0;14;Its merits were clearly established months ago. The only reason NOT to support BIP148 at this point is politics.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 09:21;0;6;abc is just another altcoin. I'm talking about Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 08:52;4;26;Segwit2x's hardfork depends on Segwit activating, so it will never activate on an anti-Segwit chain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 08:50;1;29;Dunno. Either BIP148 is harmless, or it helps them. Either way, actively supporting BIP148 is in their interests.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 08:49;5;42;And who knows, maybe their proactive support for BIP148 will convince the community to go along with the hardfork 90 days later.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 08:45;43;135;Realization: Segwit2x supporters should actively support BIP148 if miners split the chain, since only the BIP148 side can lead to their HF.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 07:50;0;1;Price goes up for everyone, not just devs... also, you're ignoring miners sabotaging our work, so price isn't as high as it might be.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 06:22;0;2;No, miners DO NOT control Bitcoin... unless the community allows/enables them to by blindly following the miners' fiat.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 05:20;1;5;Nobody should control Bitcoin. Bitcoin was designed to make it as hard as possible to control.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 04:23;0;4;1/ Bitcoin Core is not centralised at all. 2/ I don't advocate giving Bitcoin Core control of Bitcoin either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 04:22;0;1;If you want to just trust someone, there's no need for a blockchain at all.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 04:22;0;2;The I.E. isn't true, and Bitcoin is undermined merely by the existence of someone CAPABLE of these things.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 03:17;1;8;All the properties people value Bitcoin for DEPEND on it being decentralised, and not controlled by central miners (same as central banks).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 03:15;12;44;If you allow miners to control Bitcoin, it ceases to be a useful store of value too, since miners at the very least CAN inflate it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 02:40;0;2;Not if I don't get my way: if users allow miners to take-over control of Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin ceases to be interesting in that case.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;15.07.2017 02:38;0;1;I'm not the one that would be responsible.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;14.07.2017 14:25;0;1;Yes, but with less than 15% it may fail to activate Segwit and/or be vulnerable to attack.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;13.07.2017 13:49;0;5;1/ Splitting the chain hurts non-BIP148 nodes more than BIP148 nodes. It's malicious to everyone.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2017 12:41;6;25;The only way there's a split is if 51% of miners are malicious. It's not a risk, it's a choice they make. (& they can do w/o BIP148 too.);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;13.07.2017 01:14;1;4;No, it isn't unlikely. Remember, we're talking about the scenario where Bitcoin has been taken over by miners. That's not what we got into.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2017 01:13;0;3;No, it isn't and doesn't. You don't understand how Bitcoin works if you think that.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;13.07.2017 01:01;0;5;The context was someone saying if it happens, they will quit Bitcoin. I'm merely inviting him to join us on such an altcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2017 01:01;0;4;The threat of Bitcoin failing by becoming miner-controlled. If this happens, many of us are forming an altcoin to be what Bitcoin should be.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2017 00:59;3;23;(Notably, this mandatory signalling is no different than how almost all previous softforks were deployed.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2017 00:55;0;4;Liar;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2017 00:51;0;1;ALL evidence suggests it does. You will say the evidence is not conclusive, but that doesn't change the fact that it is clearly in favour.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2017 00:50;0;3;As with ANY softfork, old ex-full nodes are vulnerable to a 51% miner attack. Nothing unusual w/ BIP148 there.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2017 00:49;0;0;*IF* we end up having to go this route, it would be a fork of Bitcoin, and with Bitcoin balances preserved.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2017 00:46;0;0;The legacy chain is indeed a hardfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2017 00:45;0;1;No, a small minority does, not the market as a whole. Most people oppose such a hardfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2017 00:30;1;36;BTW, Segwit2x WILL BE an altcoin. Difference is, if I end up having to go the altcoin road, I'm willing to ADMIT it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2017 00:28;0;4;One difference is that a huge portion of the Bitcoin community (probabyl >50%) would switch to it, if that outcome came to pass.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2017 00:26;4;36;The only way an altcoin will be formed is if the community sells out to Jihan and gives up control of Bitcoin to miners. Not happening IMO.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;13.07.2017 00:23;0;1;No, Segwit2x does NOT have 90% economic agreement. That's just plain lying at this point. UASF is also far less risky.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 16:21;4;15;This is just the absolute worst-case scenario, if the community lets miners have control.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 16:05;2;17;I said a NEW altcoin, not some existing one.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 15:12;0;0;I can actually add that one.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 12:26;0;0;No, we know no such thing. Bitfury and many others have committed to enforce BIP148 come August.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 12:20;0;0;Exchanges and payment processors are just middle-men. They have to do what their customers demand.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 12:11;0;3;It's the ones that fail to enforce the rules that will be following the miners forking off.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 11:30;0;2;"The vast majority of people I encounter supporting it; Twitter polls; KYCPoll's preliminary results. All data suggests there is.";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 11:29;1;4;The vast majority of users aren't enforcing ANY rules. The reason miners should, is that failure to do so will split the network.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 11:03;0;0;This isn't correct.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 11:01;4;14;The reality is, miners don't get to decide what rules they follow. They can split the chain in retaliation, but blaming BIP148 is dishonest.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 10:57;1;8;No. Miners don't decide the rules. They follow the rules. Nothing stops them from following this one.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 10:55;0;0;I'm not promoting a chain split. I'm promoting BIP148, a softfork (= does not cause a chain split!) with widespread support.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 10:54;0;4;And it's certainly NOT hodler-vetoed! (And miners get no say in it.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 10:54;0;3;Most Core devs support BIP148, and the hold-backs mostly would if community support was clearer to them: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segwit_support …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 10:26;0;3;If most of the network is blindly running Core, that is itself a serious problem.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 10:03;0;0;It's not going to get any better than BIP148. Sorry, that's the reality.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 09:55;0;6;It would be very foolish for miners to split the chain. Split is NOT the default with BIP148. It's a softfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 09:17;1;6;Don't worry, when it comes down to it, they'll have another BIP ready for year 2020 Segwit mandatory activation.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 09:04;0;1;I would personally oppose BIP149 as-is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 08:37;0;7;If it doesn't, then the PoW change is a new altcoin, not a hardfork. = the miners have won control of Bitcoin, and it's a lost cause.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 08:30;0;1;Either a hardfork attempt succeeds w/ consensus, splits the chain, or is abandoned.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 08:18;0;1;The adjustment period can be changed in a fork just as easily as any other parameter.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 07:57;0;7;It can if there's no legit coin with the improvements. (Which there will be, because if Bitcoin gives up to miners, we will simply fork off);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 07:56;0;8;It does, because miners will see the community is willing to stand up to miner malice. Won't happen again because miners won't dare attack.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 07:44;1;14;FWIW, to properly answer your question: Myself& many others care because we own a large amount of bitcoins. Also bc IS future cryptocurrency;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 06:30;0;0;It's their choice to allow themselves to be hijacked by miners.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 06:12;0;0;We can just keep shedding the centralisers.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 06:04;0;0;Well, if miners take over Bitcoin, then a decentralised continuation of Bitcoin as an altcoin has a shot...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 05:19;0;3;On what basis do you say that? The market seems to highly favour BIP148 from what I can see.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 05:19;0;1;Prepare what? BIP148 began w/ 8 months lead time to activation. Now BIP149 is suggesting mere 6 months & BIP149 is a lot more complex/risky!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 05:01;0;2;Truth is not FUD.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 05:01;0;1;It may be of political value, but it is also a realistic concern.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 05:00;0;1;There is no reason to expect BIP149 to have any better a chance than BIP148. Nobody uses altcoins because they still have hope for Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 04:59;0;1;Can does not mean will. Why should anyone bother? Miners will just reject Segwit reformulated. And miner-controlled = useless anyway.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 04:58;0;1;Not only is this marketing, but it creates a situation where Bitcoin's network effect is inherently less long-term.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 04:58;0;1;That can only go so far. Altcoins will soon have real scaling via Lightning, which will give them a significant advantage over Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 04:38;0;8;You're proving my point (by being willing to move on to an altcoin).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 03:31;0;7;How so? What use is a miner-controlled centralised and stagnant cryptocurrency, vs something decentralised and improving?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 03:30;0;0;BIP148 is part of what makes a chain valid.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 02:15;1;3;BIP148 is Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 02:14;0;2;No, miners don't decide the rules.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 02:08;4;19;Plenty of urgency. Altcoins have Segwit, and are likely to overtake Bitcoin's lead if we were to delay it another 18 months.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 02:05;0;0;No, it isn't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 01:00;0;1;No, BIP149 is NOT significantly less contentious within Core. There is no reason to expect it to be merged either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 00:59;0;0;Developers should not (and generally don't want to) be making final decisions. We merely propose code, and users adopt it or not.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 00:58;0;14;Inventing new ways to attack does not make it any less of an attack...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 00:55;0;1;While BIP9 was designed such that redeployment was trivial, Segwit itself was not, and there are a lot of odd cases that need to be handled.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 00:55;0;3;BIP149 needs redeployment code, which is significantly more complicated than BIP148 merely activating the current deployment.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 00:52;0;0;In that scenario (with both BIPs), the chain splits only if 51% of miners fail to reject that invalid block.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 00:51;0;3;That's not correct. The situation for BIP148 and BIP149 is identical. In both cases, a miner must make an invalid block (Core never would).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 00:09;0;0;Everyone's data is different, but I think I've filtered out the most common sensitive data. Just look through the text area and make sure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 00:08;0;3;The current BIP149 proposal is more rushed than BIP148 was. And anything sooner than 18 months from now is likely dangerous.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 00:06;0;11;I'm one of the people disagreeing.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 00:05;0;1;BIP148 is also compatible with existing mining software.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 00:03;1;1;Reachable nodes is around 15% BIP148.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;12.07.2017 00:00;0;5;The timeline wasn't rushed. It began with 8 months lead time, moved up to 5 months to improve safety. BIP149 would only be 6 months.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2017 08:35;0;0;Filtered out numbers. What location details are you referring to? I don't see that...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;11.07.2017 06:49;1;0;I can't think of any features that a block size increase hardfork would be the right solution for, today... and that's on the table.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;9.07.2017 20:44;0;13;Looks like a troll who doesn't [want to] understand that Blockstream and Bitcoin Core are two different things.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2017 19:49;0;0;I said it makes censorship POSSIBLE, not mandatory.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2017 16:35;0;0;Censorship is what you get when miners are all forced to filter certain transactions on the basis of who sends/receives them.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2017 05:51;0;5;The difference is that normal full nodes *don't* need to participate in the drivechain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2017 01:42;0;1;> irrelevant data;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2017 01:24;0;0;Not necessarily. Depends on how many miners are honest vs try to attack. The latter don't get paid tho, so probably no problem.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2017 01:08;0;1;BIP148 goes into effect August 1st.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2017 00:49;0;1;That makes no sense, and sounds like just FUD...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2017 00:11;0;0;"No idea what you're saying. # BIP148 is happening; there is no bug...?";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;9.07.2017 00:08;0;1;Extblk is no good.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2017 23:28;0;3;BIP91 is redundant. Miners can adopt BIP148 to do the same thing cleaner.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2017 23:18;1;2;Arguably Bitcoin does employ and can fire the miners...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2017 22:57;0;1;Also tried to fix one of the bugs, but it got rejected.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2017 22:56;0;2;"I reviewed it a week ago https://medium.com/@lukedashjr/the-segwit-2x-beta-review-and-thoughts-ca480694a8c7 … tl;dr: no good";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2017 13:58;0;8;We should not see a split in Aug regardless. But miners could choose to retaliate.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2017 13:30;0;7;Miners can split the chain at any time.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2017 13:00;0;1;Read the rest of my point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2017 12:58;0;1;(Which I note is still strictly better than a amicable chain split - basically you can get a merge/reunion later w/ the drivechain way.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2017 12:56;0;1;(You'd not have access to the main chain this way, but it would still work and pegging can be added later.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2017 12:56;0;1;A drivechain can be made just as compatible as a hardfork for light wallets.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2017 12:53;0;3;Usage of new features may be slower, but wallets are typically auto-upgraded in terms of software.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2017 12:27;1;10;Hardforks are still wet cement. I think Drivechains can be rushed a lot safer.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2017 11:47;24;105;How about the Segwit + Drivechain path? Safe, permissionless, and gets EVERYONE what they say they want.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2017 09:41;2;30;No, but neither is Segwit2x...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2017 09:26;1;10;Could get both options without a split using Drivechains...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2017 09:07;1;17;"They never said this isn't what we want"" either...""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2017 08:08;0;0;Well, F2Pool isn't Bitmain. But Bitmain has been known to point miners to F2Pool, at least in the past (maybe they don't anymore).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;8.07.2017 00:39;2;8;Don't forget the Bitmain-controlled hashrate on F2Pool & others. Also, isn't BW Pool also Bitmain?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.07.2017 22:06;1;4;Don't feed the trolls?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.07.2017 12:15;0;15;What? They wanted passwords? O.o;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.07.2017 12:09;0;0;Now you're just trolling.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.07.2017 12:06;0;7;No, it wouldn't. The only thing that will improve these things is Lightning.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.07.2017 11:54;0;1;No, it isn't caused by full blocks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.07.2017 11:48;0;2;Lightning is fast tx & low fees, not bigger blocks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.07.2017 11:48;0;0;The idea that block size is a problem today, or that Segwit shouldn't be a priority.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.07.2017 11:33;0;3;Where are you that people are this misinformed?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.07.2017 10:59;0;0;"Such things as holding…hands,…are very dangerous. Such actions…are usually sinful…"" -Fr. Winfrid Herbst, 1946 https://archive.org/details/questionsofcatho00fath …""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.07.2017 10:15;0;3;The users don't want a hardfork right now. And Blockstream couldn't HF against their consent either.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.07.2017 07:45;0;4;That assumes the old software is still upgraded to some minimum level. The same is true with BIP148 and these proposed changes.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.07.2017 05:37;1;4;Now you're incentivising miners to maliciously hold every upgrade hostage.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;7.07.2017 05:11;0;1;getnetworkinfo, check the subversion;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 23:11;0;3;Once the softfork is active, ignoring the new rules may have financial incentives. But signalling is pre-activation, so no such incentive.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 23:10;0;0;Because the level of support for the former is much lower (economic incentive is entirely in favour) than the latter.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 23:05;0;0;You'd basically need to start the deployment over to be safe, stalling the softfork even longer.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 23:04;0;0;That would be a serious degradation in security, since only newly deployed nodes would enforce the rule even once activated.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 23:01;0;0;(Specifically in a manner that the nodes with the first deployment still are compatible with the UASF.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 23:00;0;0;So after you deploy w/ If (95% signal support) { enforce new rules after 1 retarget } noelse, how do you safely add the else later on?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 22:55;0;1;Without the mandatory signalling, you can't start off proposals as a MASF and make them a UASF later on. You have to commit upfront.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 22:50;0;2;How about the other reasons, such as the fact that it avoids having to make every single softfork a UASF?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 22:34;0;2;Except for all the reasons already outlined that it IS necessary...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 22:27;0;2;Only risk is following an invalid chain, which is unavoidable for ANY softfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 22:27;1;5;That's not true. Miners who just use Core as-is will never violate BIP148 themselves.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 22:26;0;2;Depends on other miners. Basically miners failing to upgrade in (ANY) softfork is the equivalent to SPV mining. Very unsafe.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 21:06;0;5;"It's just another consensus rule, like any other. Miners simply don't violate it. No invalid blocks = nothing gets orphaned"".""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 10:32;0;0;At least one person already did that... http://pa.xro.ca/ I don't know if trustworthy or has found any blocks yet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 09:29;0;1;Also a nice side effect can be using the mandatory signalling to avoid unnecessary UASFs. Otherwise all softforks need UASF at the start.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 09:29;0;0;Otherwise you end up in a situation where nobody really knows if (eg) Segwit is active, until someone tries to steal the coins.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 09:28;0;0;Yes, it is, which is also why it is harmless to require it. Mandatory signalling is to have an indisputable activation for the chain.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 09:12;0;9;Softforks have always required miners to upgrade. Concealing that fact just harms the network. Signal change is just a part of the protocol.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 08:32;0;5;This is ignoring the risk to the network, and the uncertainty created by neglecting to have at least temporary mandatory signalling.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 08:31;1;3;This doesn't change the optional-ness of the softforked features. Miners can still mine non-Segwit blocks even with BIP148 for example.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 08:22;0;0;Learn about Lightning. It's trustless and p2p.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 08:21;0;1;Seriously? Call me and let's discuss this (985) 655-2500;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 08:06;0;1;The problem isn't the hardfork, it's the block size increase. It increases requirements to use Bitcoin, more than anything else.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 08:01;0;1;Do you really not have any idea what is going on, or are you trolling by misrepresenting it?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 08:00;0;2;Doesn't something like OfficeMax just print whatever you want in poster form?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 07:33;1;0;That really does nothing useful for sidechains, and is fundamentally incompatible with how Bitcoin is used today.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 07:33;1;0;Lightning is higher priority since it makes Bitcoin actually scale decently. (Lightning needs Segwit.) Drivechains are also a good idea tho.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 07:31;0;0;Just run your miners on a BIP148 mining pool.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 07:31;0;0;Just that: FUD.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 03:46;0;0;Sure, my point was that these changes *don't* do harm.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 03:46;0;1;(But you may want to do some brief testing in advance anyway, to be sure they're still working...);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 03:46;0;0;"Only turn them on BEFORE August, if BIP91 needs a SMALL push to get past its 80% threshold. ;)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 03:45;0;0;First make sure you fix or firewall out the Antbleed backdoors, then just mine them on a BIP148-enabled mining pool once we get to August.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 03:42;0;0;Right. Or Spondoolies, Avalons, perhaps even Monarchs or whatever else you can find with a not-completely-useless hashrate.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 01:23;0;8;Kano is a troll and incompetent dev. And his incompetence is at the root of his rant. Nothing he says is a problem with Segwit itself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 00:54;8;26;Valid blocks are defined by users.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.07.2017 00:54;3;8;Miners need to choose software that makes valid blocks, or they by definition aren't miners [anymore].;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.07.2017 06:11;0;0;Not exactly, but it's likely a good indicator at least once any initial volatility settles.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.07.2017 06:04;0;1;It's the users of the exchange, not the exchange itself, that have the real economic weight. They can switch to another exchange anytime.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.07.2017 06:03;0;0;Not all nodes weigh the same. The more economic activity a node is responsible for, the more it matters. But exchanges are just a proxy.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;5.07.2017 05:43;0;2;The only way to minimise the risk of this, is to ensure as many people as possible are upgraded to BIP148 before August.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.07.2017 05:02;0;1;The same way you used it to mine previously, but choose a BIP148-compatible pool...?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;1.07.2017 21:21;1;1;Vatican II is anti-Catholic heresy. It has no authority to change Catholic Canon Law.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.07.2017 21:00;7;10;If you use exchanges, take your money off them until they commit to BIP148 publicly (and insist they do so to retain your business).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.07.2017 21:00;3;10;It depends on how you use Bitcoin. If you use a Core wallet, simply upgrading to https://bitcoinuasf.org/ is enough.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.07.2017 20:59;0;0;BIP148 is already deployed. Removing a deployed/established rule is a hardfork in itself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.07.2017 20:58;0;1;It's strictly forbidden, and incurs an automatic excommunication. Not my opinion, but Canon Law.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;1.07.2017 06:51;0;2;BIP148 doesn't need miners. Miners need BIP148. If they violate BIP148, their blocks are invalid and they don't get paid.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.07.2017 06:18;0;0;Not every topic needs to be explored in detail in every article. This one was about Segwit2x. Plenty of other sources why 4-8 MB is insane.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.07.2017 05:52;0;2;I'm comparing it to Core, not Alpha.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.07.2017 05:00;4;28;Much less rude than disrupting current mainnet users! At least it's expected and acceptable on testnet.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.07.2017 04:59;0;3;3) The reality remains that 1 MB per block is severely harming Bitcoin today.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.07.2017 04:58;0;6;1) Bandwidth certainly has not increased 70%/year worldwide. 2) block size has increased much faster than 70%/year, to an extreme.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.07.2017 04:52;0;5;That's what they want people to think, but it is in fact 8 MB.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.07.2017 04:52;0;2;Indeed, fixed. Thanks;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;1.07.2017 04:48;0;1;The btc1 release source code itself is the only source I used.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 07:30;0;1;Coinbase actually has a nice API that can mostly do what we need for this. :) Demo/test page:http://luke.dashjr.org/tmp/code/cbtest/cbtest.php …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 07:28;0;0;It is possible, but not necessarily better. Funds locked in CLTV cannot actually participate in economic selection of the network!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 07:28;0;2;Coinbase could fix that pretty easily...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 06:50;0;0;Okay, so how is this any different from using Coinbase/other exchanges, except that nobody will already have done it for civickey?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 05:25;0;1;One of the limitations of this method of polling. I never said it was perfect.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 05:13;0;3;Not to mention polls don't really have a double-spending problem, so there's no need for a blockchain...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 05:13;0;1;Only if you want stake-weighed miner-censorable polling...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 05:08;0;5;I don't get it. If it's anonymous, how do you prevent sybils?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 05:07;0;0;I haven't looked into other APIs yet, but Coinbase's API provides a UUID, so the polling site doesn't need to save the user's name etc.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 04:30;0;5;But you've done so for *some* exchange, right? Just need to get enough exchanges to open an API for this...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 04:27;0;0;It does trust Coinbase, but do we have a reason to suspect they would actively interfere with polling?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 04:24;0;4;"Use /s"" to denote sarcasm please. It's hard to tell sarcasm vs trolls online.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 04:21;0;0;"lol, don't forget /s""""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 04:19;0;1;Also reduction in people bothering to do it. For example, I wouldn't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 04:18;0;2;Why would Bitcoiners have an identity verified with @ civickey already? The benefit of using exchanges is everyone probably has KYC already.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 03:51;0;0;Hopefully other exchanges / KYC providers can offer a similar API. But yes, it's imperfect - but still useful data.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 01:31;0;0;Proof-of-stake polling may or may not be interesting, but it isn't what I'm looking to do in this case.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 01:30;1;15;Stop making absurd/nonsensical claims like this, or I will block you. Segwit is strictly a bugfix & restores Bitcoin's original design goals;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 01:28;0;1;Taking two words so very clearly out of context = trolling. Bye.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 01:26;0;1;Bitcoin's blockchain is not intended for polling, and PoW is not useful for polling.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 01:25;0;0;In terms of KYC integrity?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 01:15;6;39;Anyone want to help make a sybil-resistant # Bitcoin polling site based on third-party KYC verification (eg, login via Coinbase)?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 00:38;3;22;No, it isn't. HKA was about 2-4 MB blocks, not 4-8 MB blocks. And we never said we would try to force it against community consensus.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 00:30;3;13;Not just them either. *Every single* economically-significant Bitcoin user or group of users needs to consent to run it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 00:29;4;5;The decision to explicitly signal on bit 4, is either gross incompetence, or an intentional plan to back out at the last minute.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 00:28;1;3;A rather large probability they're just stalling. Otherwise, why wait for signalling at all? They could have just adopted BIP148 as a MASF.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.06.2017 00:22;0;0;No, what Segwit activation *actually* means is the ability to lock funds in Segwit UTXOs.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.06.2017 23:44;0;0;BIP148 does not cause a split. The only way a split happens is if malicious miners do it as retaliation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.06.2017 23:38;4;20;BIP148 is a bullet-proof vest. You don't need to put it on, but failing to do so puts you at risk if the miners start shooting.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.06.2017 23:37;0;3;And to be clear, BIP148 does NOT preclude a hardfork later on if the community wishes to do so.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.06.2017 23:32;10;67;The way you said it implied UASF was riskier than the alternatives, but in fact BIP148 is the LEAST risky option at this point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.06.2017 19:00;15;113;Why are you posting this very dishonest statement? Failure to upgrade to # UASF is what is truly unsafe.https://medium.com/@lukedashjr/bip148-and-the-risks-it-entails-for-you-whether-you-run-a-bip148-node-or-not-b7d2dbe85ce6 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.06.2017 18:58;0;0;Honest miners are defined as ones that don't attack Bitcoin, such as by interfering in protocol upgrades that have community support.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.06.2017 09:14;0;0;The risks exchanges take say nothing about how safe it is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.06.2017 08:53;0;0;It's not. That false advertising is part of what makes it a scam.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.06.2017 08:52;0;0;Everyone who wants Bitcoin to succeed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.06.2017 08:04;0;0;Not necessarily, no. Capitalism is not the only way things can work. Someone can develop ASICs and just sell them - no need to self-mine.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.06.2017 07:55;0;3;None of those came from Litecoin, but are cloned out of Bitcoin development.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.06.2017 07:54;0;0;With the profit element, some % of funding is going into profits rather than security.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.06.2017 06:06;0;3;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=23768.msg3815348#msg3815348 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.06.2017 05:48;0;2;Because Litecoin is a scamcoin, and there's no reason for Bitcoin to suffer because of malicious miners when we can just upgrade Bitcoin too;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.06.2017 02:27;0;3;Depends on the outcome. If price goes up on a given chain, you want to have bought/held. If it goes down, you should have sold before that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2017 23:53;0;0;As much as the network mining reward affords us (ie, probably more than we have now).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2017 21:06;0;0;My point stands. Hardforks require 100%. So 100% usage is the only reasonable expectation for one.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2017 21:04;0;0;Although since Segwit has widespread support, users do put themselves at risk by failing to run BIP148. They're not attacking though.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2017 21:04;0;0;Don't misrepresent me. It's only an attack for miners to BLOCK Segwit, regardless of BIP148. Users have the right to choose.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2017 21:02;2;5;No, it isn't. Core is putting its users at serious risk by failing to merge BIP148 before August.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2017 08:16;0;0;Well, your conclusion is wrong.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2017 07:08;0;0;There is no rational argument for 148 being an attack on miners.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2017 04:21;0;3;You think this, only because you don't know better. Time to learn the hard way, I guess. Too bad you missed 2013 when we learned.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2017 04:19;0;2;"You're wrong in thinking commit authority"" is a thing at all.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2017 04:18;2;3;The incentives are now the block reward.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2017 04:17;0;0;Hardforks are only worse in this respect. Even 1% of miners attacking is a problem with a HF. At least SF is safe so long as 51% are honest.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2017 01:10;1;15;Rusty already apologised:https://medium.com/@rusty_lightning/i-support-uasf-for-segregated-witness-75d9ef286fe5 …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2017 01:10;0;7;Everyone capable works on Core and is opposed to Segwit2x. Core isn't a formal group, it's decentralised open source development.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;28.06.2017 01:08;1;2;BIP148 doesn't cause a split. Miners can always do so, but that's true with or without BIP148.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 23:27;0;5;That doesn't make it any less trolling.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 23:17;0;9;Please can you stop trolling?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 23:16;0;0;"Also, as long as you're talking about attack from miners is possible"", realise it is ALWAYS possible, even w/o BIP148!""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 23:16;0;0;The outcome you'd rather have is not *possible*, however. It's like saying I'd rather we have Segwit activated by MASF 6 months ago.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 23:14;2;17;The future of # Bitcoin hinges on the community's willingness to stand up to hostile miners. My observations are only grounds for optimism.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 23:12;4;10;BIP148 will succeed. And it wasn't rushed, and had plenty of planning. It wasn't forced - users chose to get behind it even before devs.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 23:11;0;1;Look again. You can sort by clicking the column headers. If exchanges want help, they can email me. No reason UASF would be a disaster.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 23:10;0;4;Indeed, and it is. What's your point?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 23:09;0;0;A chain split would itself be an attack by the miners on Bitcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 23:08;0;0;BIP148 is a softfork, so it does not in itself ever produce a split. A split only occurs if 51+% of miners maliciously make an invalid chain;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 23:07;0;1;Personal observations.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 23:06;0;2;There is no reason to expect BIP149 to work if BIP148 fails. BIP149 is inferior in every way. It is riskier, more complicate,more rushed,etc;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 23:05;0;3;And failure to support BIP148 would be a HUGE liability for them, so it'd be pretty foolish not to.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 23:04;1;5;Every single exchange and wallet that has given a position at all, are onboard with BIP148 https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segwit_support#Businesses …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 23:02;1;8;BIP149 is DOA. If BIP148 does not succeed, Bitcoin will be displaced by the resulting BIP148-based altcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 23:02;0;3;Growing support just helps get there smoother and hopefully without, or with minimal, chain splitting.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 23:01;0;2;Even if it only has large minority support, we can observe from March 2013 that the most restrictive rules (the common denominator) will win;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 23:00;0;5;Indeed. Basically, we can't know for sure until it happens. But either way, the only way forward is to embrace BIP148 and support it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 22:51;1;3;Status quo isn't even an option on the table now. The only way to avoid a chain split is BIP148.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 22:51;0;1;I'm not changing the subject. Segwit2x is a hardfork. That means 100% must upgrade for it to work. So expecting 100% upgraded is reasonable.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 22:50;0;4;Those are the only meaningful metrics we have right now.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 22:47;0;0;Then hardforks are not realistic, since they don't work AT ALL without 100% adoption... (Also, most wallets support Segwit already.);;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 22:35;0;2;What?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 22:35;0;0;No, under completely ordinary circumstances.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 22:33;0;0;No, more like 4 MB on average.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 22:30;1;4;Yes, mining invalid blocks is an attack on insecure nodes that fail to detect that those blocks are invalid.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 22:22;0;5;Well, it is part of what defines an honest miner in the first place.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 22:14;3;29;If the honest miners wish to avoid it, they need to stand strong with BIP148, and demonstrate for us that they can keep the network secure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 22:13;0;0;Everyone who wants to help secure Bitcoin. As it was originally intended to be.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 20:45;0;0;That's unfortunate. Maybe you can help educate the people is your area better?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 20:45;0;0;http://Bitcoin.org has some technical documentation. I haven't read it all, but it seems reasonable. https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-documentation …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 20:43;12;91;It's not a threat, it's a defensive action to protect Bitcoin from malicious miners. Dissuading Intel/miners from acting maliciously is good;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 07:25;1;3;Only weighed to the degree that they are also a user of the network. Being a miner does not give them a privileged position.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 06:51;1;8;ASICBoost is one attack. So is blocking Segwit, now that it has been established the community supports it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 06:43;0;2;That's not realistic, and it's just as legitimate to simply change the algorithm.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 06:42;0;1;That's beside the point. 4 MB is also very unsafe.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 06:41;0;6;Attacking the network is not securing it. Packing txs into blocks is a matter of less than a second on any modern PC. Anyone can do that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 06:35;0;1;Probably no time soon. Lightning could probably push past 2 MB, but it also reduces block sizes by magnitudes, so we'd need more adoption.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 06:31;0;7;An imaginary invention used to justify the lie, yet its only purpose is to be quadrupled in the code before it has any real effect.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 06:29;1;2;8 MB blocks is insanely unsafe.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 06:29;0;2;"There is no such thing. Why not just invent a foundational block size"" and define it to be 500k, then demand that be increased? Same thing.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 06:13;2;21;Plain old Segwit adds both.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 05:58;0;3;But it's still deceptively named, since many people get the false impression it's only 2 MB blocks.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 05:57;0;7;Total block size is the only kind of block size.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 05:56;0;7;"There is no such thing as a base block size"". The concept exists only as a way to justify lies about the real size.""";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 05:27;0;5;The false association is nonsense.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 04:51;0;3;Comparisons by trolls, perhaps.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 04:39;2;6;Not a bluff. Just watch https://github.com/BitcoinHardfork/bitcoin … over the next few days.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 04:38;1;8;It'd be Bitcoin, not an altcoin. Miners don't define Bitcoin, the community does.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 04:37;2;11;Segwit2x guarantees a chain split.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.06.2017 04:36;7;45;Why do you continue to perpetuate the lie that Segwit2x is 2 MB? It is 8 MB, not 2 MB.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.06.2017 20:23;0;2;All real transactions can fit in blocks just fine, even including the stupid use cases.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.06.2017 04:34;0;1;https://github.com/luke-jr/bips/blob/bip-cbv/bip-cbv.mediawiki …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.06.2017 04:15;0;1;No, I can think of other reasons. For example, Segwit transactions cannot (yet) commit to additional post-UTXO-creation conditions.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.06.2017 03:49;0;1;But OP_RETURN actually adds data, it doesn't make the block smaller.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.06.2017 03:38;0;2;Simply not using Segwit transactions does not disrupt the network.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.06.2017 00:35;0;6;One reason why: because larger blocks are a bad idea, and using legacy txs incentivises miners to make their blocks smaller.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;26.06.2017 00:32;1;5;# BIP148 is the lowest risk option.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.06.2017 23:09;6;41;This is completely wrong. Segwit doesn't shrink transaction AT ALL. It enables 2-3 times more txs per block by increasing the block size.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.06.2017 22:29;0;10;Nothing preventing a bunch of users from changing the PoW algorithm either, and there's a lower barrier to doing just that.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.06.2017 22:15;0;6;You know, besides Bitmain's monopoly and exclusive cheats...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.06.2017 21:42;1;14;"But there isn't a need even without Segwit today, so the immediate outcome of that statement is clearly no support""...""";;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;25.06.2017 16:28;2;3;The problem isn't the discount. I already explained to the dev ML how one would do a 2 MB hardfork properly. Their 8 MB is intentional.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.06.2017 06:01;0;3;Time will tell. I don't expect Bitcoin will go everyone-everywhere global for at least another decade anyway.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.06.2017 04:47;0;0;The witness part has always been and should always be included in the block size.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.06.2017 03:36;0;6;No, it's too early to say for sure.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;25.06.2017 03:33;0;5;No. Segwit isn't a minority.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2017 22:28;2;6;By convincing the majority that it has no choice, and that it must concede its authority to the minority. But I'm not too worried.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2017 21:50;1;9;"It's just a matter of convincing the doubters. Work so that whenever they encounter Bitcoin folk, they're asked to support BIP148. ;)";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2017 20:23;12;27;I think by the time Bitcoin is ready for world population, we will be able to get up to 16+ MB blocks, which is enough with Lightning.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2017 20:04;0;1;Beyond 6B, actually. Which ironically @ VinnyLingham's propaganda agreed with anyway.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2017 20:03;0;24;Even 1 MB blocks are unsafe... BTW, did you bait me? You asked me for comments on your article... So I gave my thoughts...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2017 19:46;3;23;Miners have no authority to reject protocol changes. If there are too few honest miners, we will PoW change, not just difficulty change.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2017 19:44;6;26;No, the only one that should be merged in Core is BIP148.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2017 19:43;0;1;We need more space in the long run only. We don't need it in the near future, and having too much, too soon would be disastrous.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2017 19:42;0;1;The vast majority of bigblockers want miners to control the network. Go read r/btc a bit.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;24.06.2017 04:07;1;2;Also, softforks are protocol upgrades. Hardforks are protocol *replacements*.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2017 04:07;0;3;You mean why is it so bad if a small group of people conspire to *replace* the protocol, and succeed at it? I would think that's obvious.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2017 03:59;0;3;The danger of it setting a precedent is probably one of the worst parts of the whole thing!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2017 03:34;2;11;In reality, only a minority of companies support Segwit2x, very few users, and 0 devs. Miners don't have much say. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segwit_support …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;24.06.2017 03:33;0;3;Given those circumstances, it would be only somewhat contentious. But those assumptions don't reflect the facts around Segwit2x today.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 10:45;0;1;I didn't say there was a problem per se. But the bug is that the loop *doesn't* work out quite like that because difficulty adapts slow.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 08:35;0;18;All I said was that 16 MB blocks were NOT sufficiently large enough, because population will be >6B at some point.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 07:56;0;4;Going back to the original topic... even Mr. Rosling's estimations put us at ~10B before any drop, so 16 MB blocks is still too small L-T.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 07:49;0;2;Not going to spend the time on it. He's too busy cracking jokes, and I can't imagine what he could possibly say to counter the obvious math.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 07:44;0;1;Nope, I stuck to it for maybe the first 20 minutes, and concluded it was propaganda. 1/2;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 07:40;0;4;ALL the real world data so far supports population growth. The predictions of it stopping or declining is essentially just speculation.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 07:34;0;3;Eventually, yes. It may take generations to get there.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 07:24;0;4;You're missing the point. With each generation, we grow larger, while birth control ists remain the same. Eventually we become the majority.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 07:22;0;1;http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius11/P11CASTI.HTM …;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 07:21;0;2;It's a minority movement. But that's not relevant, because we define the future majority by virtue of our much higher fertility rate.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 07:20;0;2;Nothing of what I am saying is related to emotion in any way.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 07:19;0;2;In other words, Mr. Rosling's work doesn't take into consideration adversarial efforts to undermine his goals.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 07:18;3;3;Not only that, but they *could* deploy SW2X today. The Segwit part is DONE.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 07:18;0;2;"But not everyone is using birth control (it is evil); those of us who refuse will be the parents of the future generations proving him wrong";;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 07:16;0;2;I'm sure his predictions are perfectly sound IF you assume long-term success of the birth control propaganda taking up about half the video.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 06:54;0;3;In English?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 06:43;0;16;Looks like birth control and feminist propaganda. These people will simply go extinct or at least marginalised by those of us who don't.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 06:10;1;3;I think Bitcoin needs a higher size, long term.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 05:56;0;7;What 2 MB HF? Segwit2x is doing an 8 MB HF. I don't recall anyone actively working on a 2 MB HF at this point.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 05:44;1;2;Hmm? I don't support 1 MB blocks forever.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 05:43;0;4;I suspect game theory also demands we *sincerely* reject that framing. But regardless, I reject it anyway.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 05:21;5;27;Very few people support 1 MB blocks forever. Most talk about larger blocks being unnecessary is in the context of the near future only.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 05:17;0;3;16 MB max assumes current world population. So it's flawed if we speak beyond a single generation, assuming constant population growth.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 05:16;5;19;Segwit-only (2 MB blocks) will do much more than 7tps because of Lightning. It replaces the tps limit with a subscriber limit.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 05:14;5;13;We can observe that 1 MB is in fact a high risk to network centralisation already, so clearly the actual safe limit is lower.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 05:14;1;4;IIRC, the Cornell study found that 4 MB is *definitely not safe*, and that the safe limit was somewhere <=4 MB. It didn't claim 4 MB is safe;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 05:11;4;24;Waiting until the last minute seems like admission UASF forced their hand.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 05:10;2;7;Although I'm kinda surprised they're not aiming to do it sooner, so they can claim they did it without UASF...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 05:09;2;5;It seems fairly likely. Segwit2x claims to plan on it (just barely).;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 05:06;0;1;I tried to offer my advice and assistance to make it sane, but so far they have not accepted this help.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 05:03;0;2;No, it's unrelated. Segwit2x is flawed in so many ways at least as currently proposed.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.06.2017 05:02;16;35;And as long as Segwit2x is 8 MB block size limit, I will not support it period, neither before nor after August. 8 MB is just insane.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;14.06.2017 09:12;0;0;BIP148 is 60-80%, more than enough. It's BIP149 that is ~0% (not to mention unrealistic).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;13.06.2017 09:04;0;1;IMO BIP148 is more secure and less risky. It's BIP149 that has the risks. Litecoin used a BIP148 variant, although either would have worked.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;12.06.2017 04:00;0;0;The conclusion we came to, was that the only way to resolve the problem is to enforce the stricter rule-set as definitive.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.06.2017 20:54;0;2;BIP148 is not a 51% attack, it is merely the community activating Segwit. It works only because it has wide support.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;6.06.2017 06:04;0;5;What are you talking about?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2017 06:04;0;4;Just as many devs tell them 148 is the way to go.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2017 06:02;1;2;BIP148 is already begun deployment quite a while ago. It cannot be aborted. BIP 8/149 is also inferior to BIP 148: it creates uncertainty.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;6.06.2017 02:49;0;1;This assumes death is a worry. It's also missing the leading cause of death: abortion.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2017 22:08;0;4;But keep in mind this is WORST-CASE scenario. Realistically, miners will have to switch to stay in business, as invalid blocks are worthless;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2017 22:07;0;3;Mainly to change PoW so the network can be secure. But in this case, Segwit can simply be decidedly active in the hardfork unconditionally.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2017 22:07;0;2;If the BIP148 chain doesn't build up at least 25% hashrate in a reasonably timely manner (maybe the first month?), we may become an altcoin.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2017 19:33;0;4;No, BIP148 is not vulnerable to reorg from the legacy chain under any circumstances.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2017 08:00;0;0;The only liar here is you.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2017 07:02;0;3;BIP148 is not harmful except to Bitmain's ASICBoost. Other devs agree with making BIP148 a success.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2017 06:53;0;1;Really? Spondoolies is going full-fledged troll now that they get Bitmain funds?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;5.06.2017 06:35;0;2;It's merely a reduction of the MASF threshold and restores the mandatory signalling that all softforks prior to 2016 had. Just a distraction;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2017 22:09;0;1;No, if the period ends after 11/15, the deployment fails EVEN IF it achieved 95% during the period...;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2017 20:59;0;1;I don't do financial advice.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2017 20:58;1;0;Indeed. Someone should replace BIP 9 with something that does it by height.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2017 20:54;0;0;BIP148 is not rushed, and the only danger is malicious miners, not the proposal itself.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2017 20:53;0;0;The ONLY way to avoid disruption, is to gather more people on board of BIP148. NOTHING ELSE can prevent it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2017 20:53;0;0;Absentee pool operators will just go the way of Deepbit. It takes 51+% of miners to fail enforcing BIP148 to cause a persistent split.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;4.06.2017 20:51;0;0;It's not an ultimatum, it's a fact.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.06.2017 05:24;0;1;Again, miners can do it with or without BIP148. But it's against their economic interests either way.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.06.2017 05:03;0;2;That's how UASFs work: they compel the miners to cooperate. Litecoin's successful deployment of Segwit was caused by the UASF.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2017 05:01;0;1;BIP148 is not a hardfork.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2017 04:55;0;1;Nonsense. BIP148 is the only realistic option for Segwit. And it's also plenty safe so long as sufficient people enforce it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;2.06.2017 04:54;0;0;BIP148 does not do that.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;2.06.2017 04:49;0;0;It's the opposite. BIP148 will either have a clearer winner, or as a *worst case*, one as equally unclear as BU vs Core.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;30.05.2017 15:47;2;8;BIP148 is happening whether you support it or not. SW has support from the community, and if you don't like it, you can simply not use it.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;30.05.2017 15:43;0;1;Uh, DAOs are not useful for mining. Closest I can think of is having a shareholder-held mining company, but that's strictly worse than pools;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.05.2017 22:58;1;4;Need? No. But if you want to help support Segwit, you could punish miners if they split the chains by selling legacy coins (and buy BIP148?);;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;29.05.2017 19:44;5;13;Even if exchanges didn't support BIP148, and miners split the chain, we could all just sell-off our legacy coins to get the market effect.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;29.05.2017 18:52;4;14;Nodes won't follow hardforks at all, even with 100% miner support, unless their code is updated to support the hardfork.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;11.05.2017 04:45;3;27;No, not a single one has (at least for Bitcoin). The one hardfork ever was in May (not March!) 2013, to increase the block size to 1 MB.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;19.04.2017 16:06;1;0;No. Bitcoin may have more than 1 chain longterm. There are also economic variations that can compete (ie, Freicoin).;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;1.02.2017 22:47;0;0;Not nearly as large numbers as the unborn children being murdered here in the USA. Please priorities that first!;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.01.2017 21:16;0;1;Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as an orphaned block. A *stale* block has an orphan generation tx.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;31.01.2017 21:14;0;0;Maybe related somehow to the Judicial Branch abusing its power to be de facto legislators for decades now?;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;27.01.2017 04:47;0;1;If it isn't a problem, then they should be using their own full node. That they aren't, proves it is.;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;27.01.2017 04:42;1;1;Actually, it's neutral with regard to segwit activation.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;23.01.2017 03:38;0;0;It's not possible to get 1 MB of stripped-size right now. Only 500-750k. Why are you looking at the stripped size at all?;;;;;;;;
LukeDashjr;23.01.2017 03:37;0;0;That makes no sense. Excluding the tx data, the block itself is always 81-83 bytes, with or without segwit.;;;;;;;;

LukeDashjr;10.01.2017 19:03;0;3;No. Litecoin is merely copying the innovation developed for Bitcoin, even if activates Segwit earlier.;;;;;;;;
