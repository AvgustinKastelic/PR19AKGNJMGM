CryptoCred;28.12.2018 15:03;0;7;The level on your H1 chart is 3600.0 On this LTF chart you’re selling at 3607.5 (support you yourself identified) and that’s before price even traded meaningfully below 3600 per your own chart, so it can’t be resistance (certainly not on H1) Maybe just a different style
CryptoCred;28.12.2018 14:54;0;9;Could you help me out here, I’m also interested At the time you entered 3.5/3.6 was still support, hadn’t turned resistance because price didn’t trade to 3.4> So it looks like you hit the sell at your own support level (after a 4% rip down) and stuck a $20 stop on it

CryptoCred;14.12.2018 22:35;0;5;I don't need lectures on the law. I never advertised or even spoke about his fund. I had 1 Telegram message about the mentorship, which is distinct.
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 22:25;0;6;Yes, and those comments were about the mentorship, NOT about his fund for investors. How is this so hard to understand?
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 22:21;0;7;The idea of the mentorship is that the fees go into an account and he trades it live. He wins, he keeps money & people see live trading. He loses, he makes no money from 'teaching'. It's not an investment -- it's skin-in-the-game teaching. DIFFERENT from his fund for investors
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 22:19;0;0;No! By fund I meant they're kept on a separate Mex account that he trades live as part of the mentorship. He was going to trade the mentorship fees and keep any winnings/not make money if he loses. That is ENTIRELY different from fund as in people investing money w/ him.
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 22:16;0;3;Show me ONE screenshot of me promoting his fund in Telegram. What an absurd thing to say. The screenshot was regarding his mentorship group. You've clearly misunderstood.
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 22:14;0;1;No one promoted his fund -- what are you on about?
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 22:12;0;4;I actually think you two would get along very well.
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 22:08;0;15;I'm not surprised. People who've always disliked me for one reason or another are just using this nothingburger as an excuse to pile on. Pathetic and predictable.
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 21:59;0;8;1. Sure, I'll take poor choice of words 2. This is hindsight as fuck. At the time, he was active, constantly posting trades (publicly and in certain Discords we shared), and coming off hot in the Cartel competition. The idea of live trading group fees was cool. That's it.
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 21:55;0;4;If you want to have a long-ass debate about the specific adjective I employed in a Telegram post, feel free I’m clearly not operating in bad faith and have clarified several times now what I meant by the term
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 21:53;0;6;We didn’t even do that, he was (and clearly remains) notoriously unreachable via DMs It’s astonishing how much my language is being read into here Personal/personally simply meant known to me beyond just some random on Twitter e.g. we share(d) a Discord where he’d post trades
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 21:51;0;2;I believe that to be correct, but not based on any personal information but rather the news articles that surfaced around XHV fiasco time
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 21:48;0;1;I don’t have shit on him “Personal friend” is an endearing term for people whom I engage(d) with beyond just Tweets/following one another That said I believe it’s true when I say he’s not fully anonymous and some parts of his identity were disseminated around the XHV fiasco
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 21:40;0;7;It’s a term I use for people I engage with beyond Tweets e.g. if we share Discord channels, have spoken privately via DMs, and so on I have not met him and his identity is unknown to me (though not the internet) Are you going to ignore my other points & invite a Twitter circus?
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 21:37;0;11;2/2 The mentorship and fund are/were totally distinct My TG post was deleted before the mentorship even launched, not as some cover up If you’re arguing that posting about the mentorship in TG is somehow akin to inducing people to invest in his illegal fund — you’re dense
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 21:29;0;7;Love u Jonny
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 21:28;1;28;This is duplicitous I posted his mentorship for about an hour in my Telegram because it was a great idea: CS was hot trading-wise & the live trading idea was cool. Deleted 1H later, *not* recently. All of that has fuck all to do with people ‘investing’ in his ‘fund’.

CryptoCred;14.12.2018 11:59;0;2;Pleasure, thanks for engaging
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 11:52;0;8;2/2 With regard to follow-up profits: 1. It's a slightly different style of trading, you're likely to be in more trades level-to-level as opposed to waiting for big swing setups 2. As mentioned, re-entry if FTA structure gets blown through is always an option
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 11:50;0;11;I'd articulate it thus: FTA is ascertained on the same time frame as the entry structure, unless there is a clear HTF bias structure present. In that case, FTA is ascertained on D1/higher time frame. Note: some systems will ALWAYS give you a HTF bias. Mine doesn't.
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 11:47;0;1;Great way of phrasing it!
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 11:42;0;13;Good question! I use certain structures/patterns/formations to establish a high time frame bias. If there is a high time frame bias present, and my trade is in the same direction, FTA is ascertained on the D1 time frame, NOT the entry time frame. So I still get swing setups.
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 11:38;0;12;I don't personally. I close full size at FTA. If price blows through it, 1) no big deal 2) the FTA structure can be used for a continuation trade e.g. if I'm long and get out at FTA resistance that price blows through, that's now turned support that I can buy later
CryptoCred;14.12.2018 11:33;1;20;The way I like to do it is ascertain FTA on the same time frame that I ascertained entry structure E.g. if I'm buying an H1 level my FTA will be an H1 resistance, if buying M15 structure my FTA will be M15 resistance and so on Does that answer your question?

CryptoCred;17.11.2018 20:31;0;37;Not sure how many times I have to explain this. It's not a bullish Tweet. I'm making a case for getting long above 6000s as opposed to guessing which support from a year ago will hold. Price isn't above 6000s, so I'm not looking for any swing longs.

CryptoCred;21.09.2018 18:31;0;5;For sure After some time most people can get a good idea of entry and stop, but completely mess up target (either picking something silly or not managing it at all & letting it return to BE for no good reason)
CryptoCred;21.09.2018 18:27;0;7;Kinda how I go about it (largely WMD4X superb template) 1) Forecast (where do I think price is going) 2) Entry trigger (is there a setup that meets my rules) 3) Invalidation (where’s the entry trigger wrong) 4) RR (do the entry & invalidation & target give enough RR)
CryptoCred;21.09.2018 18:21;0;6;Or at least if you’re setting bigger, swing targets which ‘ignore’ intermediate resistance levels — manage the damn thing
CryptoCred;21.09.2018 18:12;0;9;These days, at least 1.5:1 where the target is the next resistance/support on the time frame that I entered Subject to change depending on win rate + other data
CryptoCred;21.09.2018 18:08;50;408;Risk:Reward is useful only if your target (Reward) is realistic. Too many people set unreasonable targets and then justify the trade because it’s ‘good R:R’.

CryptoCred;22.08.2018 20:33;0;18;‘Assume all else is equal’ The point is to show people that higher leverage != bigger position size, and moving the leverage slider on an existing position won’t make you more money All about dat position size Smh scientist dogs always overcomplicating things

CryptoCred;11.06.2018 22:00;0;4;2/2 I believe you're saying you can derive an R for your trades based on win rate to maximise chances of being profitable In the video, I argue for the same thing I was simply saying mere assertions about R w/o considering win rate are wrong Don't think we disagree
CryptoCred;11.06.2018 21:44;0;4;"The claim in the video is that there's no fixed R:R to pursue e.g. ONLY 2:1 or above. The 2nd claim is that if you know the avg R of your trades, you can derive the minimum win rate you need to be profitable. I'm not quite sure what you're saying; seems like a misunderstanding."
CryptoCred;11.06.2018 21:31;0;2;In the video I state that there's no real magic R:R to pursue *because* it depends on what one's win rate is That seems to be what you're saying here Did you watch the video?

CryptoCred;26.05.2018 21:05;118;574;Portfolio Management Tip Don't do this. Owning different kinds of altcoins won't reduce your risk. They all mostly behave in the same way in relation to i) Bitcoin ii) other altcoins. So you're simply increasing altcoin exposure. Go to cash and/or short Mex products.https://twitter.com/cryptomanran/status/998730826501230592 …

CryptoCred;10.04.2018 16:36;0;5;OK, I understand. I'm glad we agree on the importance of seeing the Twitter handle. I'm no Twitter policeman, I just have high standards for evidence when it comes to big accounts that're most prone to impersonation. I'm sure that makes sense to you too.
CryptoCred;10.04.2018 16:30;0;6;It wasn't messaged to you directly so you have no way of verifying whether it was indeed Gat that was part of that conversation, or whether it was an account which stole the name + picture. If anything it's suspicious that the full handle was ommitted. I'd consider retracting.
CryptoCred;10.04.2018 16:28;0;4;What's the risk? Someone makes an account named CryptoCred, steals my picture, but the handle is CryptooCred or CryptoCred_ etc. Then they go scam/shill et cetera. My only defence would be to prove that's not me by showing that the Twitter handle isn't the same. Make sense?
CryptoCred;10.04.2018 16:26;0;7;You misunderstand me. I am asking for a basic standard of proof - that the full handle is visible so one can objectively ascertain if you were talking to Gat or someone else. I am not defending anything or anyone. I am asking for reliable evidence.
CryptoCred;10.04.2018 16:22;0;6;Well then could you post a screenshot which shows the full Twitter handle of the person that conversation took place with? Remember: you can change your name + steal a profile picture easily. Your screenshot proves nothing until the FULL Twitter handle is visible.
CryptoCred;10.04.2018 16:20;0;5;I'm not tarnishing anything, mate. I'm simply asking you if you have access to the full screenshot which would either fully prove or fully disprove what you're saying.
CryptoCred;10.04.2018 16:16;0;2;This doesn't prove much unless the FULL Twitter handle can be seen - there're a ton of impersonators who vary the username slightly

CryptoCred;20.02.2018 22:43;35;203;3/2 (yes I know) You should be thinking: Bull market: what can I do now to protect myself from a bear market (e.g. taking profits to $ BTC and fiat, etc.) Bear market: what can I do now to be best positioned for a bull market (e.g. buying depressed alts, scaling in2 $ BTC, etc.)
CryptoCred;20.02.2018 22:37;24;177;2/2 Prime example: If you didn't even contemplate selling any $ BTC on the vertical run to 20k, but suddenly were looking for any bounce to sell into down at 6-8k, you're doing it wrong.
CryptoCred;20.02.2018 22:36;265;832;Portfolio Management Tip Take profits in a bull market & you'll be better positioned for a bear market. Accumulate the panic selling in a bear market & and you'll be better positioned for a bull market. Preparing for a market shift *in advance* = beating the herd. Simple.

CryptoCred;8.02.2018 23:36;0;4;Only 2! What a steal!
CryptoCred;8.02.2018 23:12;13;156;Lots of Bitmex Tweets around showing high ROE percentages. Reminder: The percentages themselves are *utterly meaningless*. For all you know, they opened a testnet position in both directions at high leverage and are posting the profitable one. Be skeptical.
CryptoCred;8.02.2018 20:01;0;11;Example I enter an Altcoin/BTC trade with X BTC. I exit the trade with more BTC than I entered with. I take a fraction of the surplus and use it to buy the coin I want to accumulate.
CryptoCred;8.02.2018 19:50;105;512;Portfolio Management Tip If you're long-term bullish on a coin, take a % of every profitable trade and use it to buy that coin. Even 10%> profits from each trade going towards that coin will compound quickly & build a solid position. Works especially well with low caps.

CryptoCred;7.02.2018 21:53;0;6;Yes - and my post was aimed at those who don't revise anything and just let it 'go', often allowing a trade/remainder of it to drop back to break even/the original stop because they didn't bother to amend it or close it on the way up.
CryptoCred;7.02.2018 21:40;0;3;Disingenuous is a bit harsh. And I really think you're mistaken if you think this type of behaviour isn't ubiquitous across all caps. What I'm saying also doesn't contradict a moonshot scenario - just amend targets and adjust stops.

CryptoCred;4.02.2018 02:25;0;6;I agree - swing low setup isn't convincing. Bulls better hope it's the weekend volume and that the swing low is 'set in stone' by a much more bullish day. Paper thin.

CryptoCred;27.01.2018 04:15;105;353;My strategy for identifying and trading major trend reversals is outlined in these two Tweets. It helps you identify when a market top/bottom may be bottom, and also gives you a precise buy/sell signal. IMHO this is a really powerful & interesting strategy.

CryptoCred;5.01.2018 09:00;7;34;P.P.S. If you're a newer follower and have neither watched my RSI video nor seen my earlier post, I covered trendlines on RSI very briefly in this Twitter post with and added an excerpt from Murphy's book.https://twitter.com/cryptocred/status/941508815513669632 …

CryptoCred;5.01.2018 08:51;2;18;P.S. as I mentioned in my RSI video, there's no reason why RSI can't just consolidate at the mid point and thus give some God-tier altcoin season. Still want to see how this interaction with the trendline is resolved, or even if it remains significant. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

CryptoCred;4.01.2018 21:55;0;11;Addendum: Since I've had some confused DMs - 'targets' are NOT targets for a trade or suggesting to take a position. Rather, these are key levels I want to see the bulls take out to see more upside. Supports are the range low (14.5-14.7k) and 4H Kijun that price bounced from.

CryptoCred;28.12.2017 16:04;2;15;Simplest version: Look at the dotted line. If price touches it and can't break above it, I expect it to get pushed down lower towards the blue box. If price touches it and does break above it, I want it to challenge the two undotted horizontal lines.
CryptoCred;28.12.2017 15:59;1;1;Think if we break blue box it'll be violent. Breaking above dotted line should give a nice pop but there're some highs there I outlined and want price to take out.

CryptoCred;27.12.2017 15:57;0;16;Please apply some critical thinking. I'll never be able to capture the full scope of exceptions and nuance in a Twitter post. I tried my best in the thread itself and in the addenda above. Bottom buyers are minority. More have been buying tops and avging down/rebuying higher.
CryptoCred;27.12.2017 15:55;0;9;In case it wasn't clear: Exceptions: I) Buying the real bottom/ICO. Course you can HODL, though it may never reach previous highs (or not soon at least).

CryptoCred;27.12.2017 12:55;0;1;Lol, FUD. Are you refuting the central claim that the majority of the most liquid altcoin pairs are paired with $ BTC and thus subject, as we have seen over and over again, so its volatility?
CryptoCred;27.12.2017 12:50;0;0;Must I repeat myself? If you buy a new coin that blows up you've done well. That's the minority. If you buy the top of an altcoin's cycle/market's cycle that goes to shit, and you keep adding to it/averaging down, you haven't done well. That's a lot of people.
CryptoCred;27.12.2017 12:46;0;0;1) Doesn't relate to what I am talking about 2) I covered early purchaser exception 3) This is preceding the insane altcoin bull market(s) 4) My post relates to those who bought and have been holding/averaging down higher cap alts from the top of their mkt cycle Must I go on?
CryptoCred;27.12.2017 12:22;4;33;A very short thread on my views regarding portfolio management and altcoins more generally. That's the last post from me today - I promise! Will answer questions tomorrow.https://twitter.com/cryptocred/status/945974027352461313 …
CryptoCred;27.12.2017 12:19;5;53;If you find yourself losing big chunks of your portfolio value and/or getting upset when $ BTC price goes up, it likely means that you're overweight altcoins and underweight Bitcoin. Which is a synonym for 'your portfolio management is shitty'. /Fin
CryptoCred;27.12.2017 12:19;1;14;Thus: With the exceptions (IMO) being super low caps/new coins that you find on a shitty exchange, mine yourself, et cetera: It doesn't make sense to me to religiously HODL and 'average down' your altcoin bags while $ BTC slingshots them around at will.
CryptoCred;27.12.2017 12:19;2;15;Clarification. IMO: Until altcoins become decoupled from $ BTC (i.e. paired in USD and so on), they're at the mercy of Bitcoin's volatility. We have days where all of Bittrex is green and some where all of Bittrex is red - you're telling me fundamentals align like the stars?
CryptoCred;27.12.2017 12:12;0;1;Ya there're obviously exceptions (seldom will a blanket statement like that stick) but the broader point is a lot of people bought the top of altcoin market bull runs and 'averaged down' etc. and turned, often involuntarily, into investors/HODLers.
CryptoCred;27.12.2017 12:05;18;103;When I read that someone is a 'long-term altcoin investor/HODLer' all I can see is 'bought the top of a bull market/rally and didn't know what a stop loss was'. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
CryptoCred;27.12.2017 11:48;1;6;I definitely also see 15.3-15.4 as the support of the range we're currently in. If that breaks, reckon we could see a test of the 15k resistance turned support (dotted)? Doesn't look like we definitively retested that level.pic.twitter.com/qHTIxFG93L

CryptoCred;26.12.2017 11:59;3;30;Quick thing: I'll do my best to post a naked setup and then one with the all the indicators.

CryptoCred;26.12.2017 11:55;0;2;Original!
CryptoCred;26.12.2017 11:27;0;1;To a large extent the former. It's an interesting area to research (beyond the scope of a twitter reply) so some Googling should take you on an interesting journey.
CryptoCred;26.12.2017 02:10;0;1;My next lesson will be on that. What I do: put my stop on the condition that proves I was wrong to enter. E.g. I enter on a key horizontal, s-l is below it I enter on a h&s top pattern, s-l is above the right shoulder I enter on a pattern, s-l is pattern support Et cetera

CryptoCred;25.12.2017 22:37;5;55;It is not about knowledge. It is about probability, and stacking the odds in your favour. E.g. you buy a strong support zone not because you know that price will bounce, but because the odds of it doing so are higher than had you bought elsewhere. 7/

CryptoCred;20.12.2017 21:28;1;4;I was asked by @ zjoao about the 4H Kijun - so thanks for the idea & reminding me to update and share with you guys how I'd track this based on Cloud. If it turned more bearish, I'd also start looking at 1D Cloud lines too. Hope that helps!
CryptoCred;20.12.2017 21:10;0;1;Also 4H Cloud support/Senkou A support is worth keeping an eye on.
CryptoCred;20.12.2017 21:09;0;0;Yes - the 4H Kijun hasn't held and price is headed towards a bearish TK cross (but still no confirmation). I think the 16.3 zone is interesting for the other reasons stated which remain valid - 2H Cloud & 50% retracement (as well as the horizontal level thereabouts).

CryptoCred;20.12.2017 01:09;3;8;Reminder of my basic framework for tracking $ BTC using 4H Cloud: 1. Breach below Tenkan = reasonable short opportunity 2. If (1) happens, bids at Kijun = reasonable long opportunity 3. If (2) works, adding to long at breach above Tenkan = reasonable long opportunity

CryptoCred;19.12.2017 14:42;0;0;What do you mean?
CryptoCred;19.12.2017 14:26;0;5;Additionally: worth noting the growing C-Clamp/TK disequilibrium on this setup. Increases the likelihood of a move to the Kijun, but not definitive by any means, especially with how aggressive the dip buying has been.
CryptoCred;19.12.2017 14:22;0;8;Worth noting: I have other levels/Fibs et cetera on my chart, but this is the most straightforward way to analyse it. It's not about catching the bottom wicks, rather it's about positioning yourself to ride big portions of the big moves. In my opinion, of course.
CryptoCred;19.12.2017 13:45;0;29;This chart also highlights another belief of mine: breaches of major supports/resistances offer the most profitable moves, because they tend to be the most violent & volatile moves. Don't get distracted by the short-term noise: map out key levels & make money from breaches.
CryptoCred;19.12.2017 13:42;2;34;$ BTC Update An excellent showcase of why I like to draw trendlines on RSI.

CryptoCred;5.12.2017 22:29;1;9;Time for @ CryptoBully to 'chart' another triangle
CryptoCred;5.12.2017 20:05;0;0;Empirically this is true. Lots of countries have experimented w/ different systems (pegged to $, pegged to something else, less cash, diff fiscal/mon policies whatever) and advanced capitalist economies don't give two shits. It's the beauty of monetary sovereignty.
CryptoCred;5.12.2017 20:01;0;0;This space is rife with this kind of stuff unfortunately, Peter (though I know it's not news to you). Really hope as crypto gains more attention & legitimacy, the arguments in its favour become more grounded in reality also. No one wants to hear Peter Schiff goldbugs on 'roids.
CryptoCred;5.12.2017 19:59;0;2;Do you not feel that the integrity of your argument is at least very slightly threatened by the fact that modern capitallist economies are fighting deflationary pressures despite a historic expansion of the monetary base for close to a decade post-crisis? Wheres the inflation?
CryptoCred;5.12.2017 19:58;0;1;This is my position also. Use case for crypto needs to be made in a reasonable & evidence-based way, not by fearmongering people w/ misinformed claims about US debt, hyperinflation, replacing fiat, etc.
CryptoCred;5.12.2017 19:57;0;1;"Sure, I was more replying to the allegation that somehow it was big government"", which is a phrase intellectually lazy lolbertarians use to 'explain' away any sort of regulatory initiative w/o having to engage with the argument."""
CryptoCred;5.12.2017 19:54;0;1;100% If anything I'd be for inflationary cryptos used by central banks/govts that they can use to inject liquidity where it's needed in the economy (as opposed to just buying corp. debt) and that intervention being accountable/visible via the blockchain.
CryptoCred;5.12.2017 19:52;0;1;"Lol. The banking crisis was caused by a slowdown in the demand for credit by the private sector. Demand for credit played such a big role in aggreggate demand in the economy that a slowdown was itself enough to cause debt deflation; defaults etc. Big gov's fault"" = laziness."""
CryptoCred;5.12.2017 19:51;0;1;*without, lol.
CryptoCred;5.12.2017 19:51;0;2;Until such an argument can be clearly made with voodoo economics, weird semantical trickery, false analogies etc., I respectfully don't share your vision & think case for crypto can be made in more evidence-based ways. 2/2
CryptoCred;5.12.2017 19:50;0;2;"If you can present a clear argument which shows that 1) all fiat currencies are inter-related and no meaningful distinctions can be made between them e.g. Yen = Bolivar; 2) the collapse of one necessitates that of the other; 3) crypto will be the replacement, I'll read it. 1/2"
CryptoCred;5.12.2017 19:44;0;2;That's fine. They can choose to do that. I don't see a necessary connection btwn economies with serious inflation reforming their monetary structures & somehow that extending to a general failure of fiat which then somehow 'forces' advanced econs. to adopt it too.

CryptoCred;2.12.2017 15:26;0;1;I didn't adjust to the slightly higher high (I had the Fibs drawn from the first test) because the levels acted nicely as support. Very marginal difference anyway.

CryptoCred;30.11.2017 18:43;0;3;But Sir don't you know it doesn't work?
CryptoCred;30.11.2017 15:43;0;3;Absolutely with you on that one. Inherent difficulty in squaring smth to be used for payments and smth to be deflationary. I'd prefer $ BTC to stay deflationary and let the technology do (most of) the payments part via other cryptos.
CryptoCred;30.11.2017 15:40;0;1;See the comment I made just above about $ BTC being hyperdeflationary i.e. it doesn't make any economic sense to spend it given how much it's going up in value.
CryptoCred;30.11.2017 15:39;1;6;I feel that's one issue with BTC, and been echoed by many econs. It has turned hyperdeflationary in its current case i.e. it just doesn't make sense to spend Bitcoin since its value is increasing so rapidly. Either thatll have to end, or other cryptos fill that purpose. Not both.
CryptoCred;30.11.2017 15:31;0;3;Me too! I think once or perhaps if the use case of a better payment service system is established & acknowledged, lower volatility will follow.
CryptoCred;30.11.2017 15:26;0;1;Post-crisis expansion of the monetary base while CPI remained more or less flat. Where's the inflation risk? Where's the promised 20%? Just sharing my PoV that it's harder to inflate than you might think!pic.twitter.com/4MRLSLvDDr
CryptoCred;30.11.2017 15:24;0;7;I agree with you entirely and humbly submit that the payment service & value retention argument should be at the forefront if the space wants to be taken more seriously. Thanks for engaging! Much respect.
CryptoCred;30.11.2017 15:20;0;0;Inflation isn't one-sided. If you destroy the productive capacity of an economy OR it's not monetary sovereign, the risks increase. US, Japan, UK etc. modern post-crisis capitalist economies printed billions yet still battle with low inflation. Austrian econs said 20% CPI
CryptoCred;30.11.2017 15:16;0;7;I think if cryptocurrency advocates want to be taken seriously, they/we must start making serious, evidence-based arguments for the value prop. of $ crypto, not fear-monger the public with goldbuggery and fallacious analogies w/ historical cases of hyperinflation.

CryptoCred;23.11.2017 13:42;0;1;No idea! Past bearish moves have taken $ BTC into the Kumo Cloud on the 1D and if that takes place soonish, it would fall around that zone. But there's difference between a technical pullback from ATH levels/failing to breach a level, and turning bearish for a bigger move.
CryptoCred;23.11.2017 13:34;0;3;Sorry for re-posting. I meant to say Tenkan, not Kijun. This is because the Tenkan - the blue line - has supported this whole run up and I expect some blood if it breaks (like in the past).

CryptoCred;16.11.2017 11:57;0;3;@ DreaminCrypto pointed out something worth clarifying: It's not necessarily the case that we seamlessly go to channel resistance and retrace. There's obviously resistance at previous highs in the 7.5-7.6k zone which may dampen the rally. The support zone is 6.7 - 6.9k Thanks!
CryptoCred;16.11.2017 11:51;0;0;I said sense way too many times, but hope that's intelligible.
CryptoCred;16.11.2017 11:48;0;0;I think a pullback to the first/red zone would be sensible and makes sense in my mind. As for the green lines, I like to plot both scenarios a lot of the time (i.e. if I am completely wrong) and showing what I think a breakout would look like. Hope that makes sense!

CryptoCred;24.10.2017 23:59;0;0;Yep, worth keeping an eye on for sure. I was just trying to point out how price has been respecting Tenkan this whole run, now being tested!
CryptoCred;24.10.2017 23:22;0;0;Good point! Forgot about that. Bullish presumption on BTC seems wise, though I sense sentiment is shifting.
CryptoCred;24.10.2017 23:19;0;0;I see that! Cheers for chipping in Ledger Status. I opted for 4H since it's more popular (I think?) but I see the 6H case. My analysis ok?
CryptoCred;24.10.2017 23:18;0;0;Gotcha. Quite the drop if it goes that way! Is my analysis broadly correct? Though on a shorter time frame than the daily, of course.
CryptoCred;24.10.2017 20:02;0;3;Some of my setups/charts were successful and broke upwards...so did the whole altcoin market. Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
CryptoCred;24.10.2017 20:00;2;12;Be cautious of those re-tweeting their charts from a few days ago hailing them as a TA success. Every shitcoin and its grandmother pumped.
CryptoCred;23.10.2017 19:02;0;1;That being said, $ MTL needs to cool off on lower time frames which should give me a chance to buy closer to the support I've outlined. /End
CryptoCred;23.10.2017 19:01;0;0;Note: this isn't supposed to be 100% precise. Rarely will you buy perfectly on support and sell right at resistance. And you don't have to.
CryptoCred;23.10.2017 00:29;0;2;Have not seen anyone track $ BTC with the same diligence and eye for repeat patterns as @AndrewEmerickJr. Very cool stuff.https://twitter.com/AndrewEmerickJr/status/922227052782280704 …
CryptoCred;23.10.2017 00:06;0;0;I strongly suggest you use this time to look for research and capital preservation above all else. The next bull run will thank you for it!
CryptoCred;23.10.2017 00:03;0;0;Lots of research going on in @ cryptonator1337's Discord to be best prepared for the altcoin boom (whenever that may be). THIS GUN BE GOOD.

CryptoCred;15.10.2017 16:32;0;0;It is overbought on this time frame and the pattern is bearish, but enough volume could mean it breaks out and invalidates the wedge.

CryptoCred;14.10.2017 17:30;0;0;I'm not making a prediction as to whether the pennant will be broken or not per se, I'm engaging whether it's already broken or not.
CryptoCred;14.10.2017 17:21;0;1;Hahaha it's just an expression, I swear!
CryptoCred;14.10.2017 17:18;0;0;Correction: I should have said break, not test. I count even a wick touching as a test and the price breaking above the pattern as a break.
CryptoCred;14.10.2017 16:30;0;1;That being said, descending triangles tend to be continuation patterns of a downtrend. No material downtrend here. Bolsters case for pennant

CryptoCred;7.10.2017 23:22;0;5;Slightly more analysis. But 100% check @AndrewEmerickJr $ BTC levels he just posted, because he's a lot better than me.pic.twitter.com/3waGRFob0T
CryptoCred;7.10.2017 23:06;0;23;Looks like a rising wedge on $ BTC developing. Gonna keep an eye on this. Feedback/criticism welcome, I've gotten this pattern wrong before.pic.twitter.com/jUM0kVChDy
CryptoCred;6.10.2017 20:48;0;0;"Pitchforks at rest, crypto twitter. I've followed them all. Guess reading their tweets twice won't hurt ;)"
CryptoCred;6.10.2017 20:40;0;2;Indeed. Crazy, isn't it? (I started following them all on my IRL account some time ago, just never migrated here. Use my IRL Twit more).
CryptoCred;6.10.2017 20:32;2;3;@ FatihSK87 @ CarpeNoctom @ ledgerstatus @ galaxybtc @ collapzcursed @AndrewEmerickJr You drive me to improve. Thank you. 2/2

CryptoCred;6.10.2017 11:54;0;0;Correction: $ VIA bounced lower than where I suggested. I was mistaken.
CryptoCred;4.10.2017 23:53;0;0;Hey! Posted an updated chart as a reply :)
CryptoCred;3.10.2017 23:27;0;0;Hard to say without also having information on the catalyst. I usually just wait for confirmation of a reversal across multiple time frames.
CryptoCred;3.10.2017 23:11;1;1;Thanks for interacting! I think $ OMG will do great things. Just charting what I see :)
CryptoCred;1.10.2017 05:02;0;1;And thank you to @ crypto_rand for this excellent interview:https://medium.com/@cryptorand/interview-with-quantum-resistant-ledger-founder-qrl-471c31052720 …

CryptoCred;1.10.2017 00:08;0;1;I respectfully disagree. See below from St Louis Fed. Issuer of free-floating fiat can't be held hostage by bond vigilantes.pic.twitter.com/1GEEakXXBq
CryptoCred;29.09.2017 00:31;0;1;Thanks for your time - very kind of you. Much appreciated.
CryptoCred;28.09.2017 23:31;0;2;@ ledgerstatus I've found your use, description, and explanation of ichimoku enlightening. Any resources you'd recommend for learning? Thanks
CryptoCred;28.09.2017 22:53;0;0;@ WaseetTaswq Please DM me regarding Cryptonator's group.
CryptoCred;28.09.2017 06:43;0;0;Yes, there's another good trend line I could have drawn going from the top wick. Pardon the recklessness in these ungodly hours...
CryptoCred;28.09.2017 04:09;0;0;@AndrewEmerickJr Hey - blog post re TA still forthcoming? Thanks.
