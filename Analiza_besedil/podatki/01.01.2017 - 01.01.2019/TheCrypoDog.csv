TheCryptoDog;30.12.2018 02:13;0;2;Haha thanks buddy. I'm still off the charts until Monday, just sneaked a quick peak this afternoon.

TheCryptoDog;25.12.2018 05:29;0;1;That would be incredible, I'll be happy to stop out my short and ride spot all the way up, catching a leveraged long and increasing $ ALT exposure if the opportunity presents itself.

TheCryptoDog;25.12.2018 05:24;0;1;If $ BTC had chadd'ed my short would have closed at a small loss and $ TRX would have mooned. I was covered in either scenario.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;25.12.2018 05:23;0;0;I understand the high TF overbought conditions. I was comfortable with the risk and it fit within my trading strategy.

TheCryptoDog;25.12.2018 05:19;11;107;I am expecting a bounce here across the board on $ crypto. I'm not playing it. It's Christmas and I'm sufficiently spooked. If the bounce is strong, it could change everything. If no bounce, then YEESH.pic.twitter.com/9B0YBQvk3U;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;24.12.2018 09:56;0;0;I just re-opened the chart on Tradingview and it appears it didn't save the changes I made earlier. This is exactly how my $ TRX/BTC chart has looked for months.

TheCryptoDog;24.12.2018 09:55;0;0;Why would you assume that I would use that line as a stop loss? That's so bizarre. I don't draw my exact entry, SL, exit on almost ANY of my charts on Twitter. That line I literally drew months ago and it's existed on my chart to this day.;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;24.12.2018 08:54;0;0;I read almost all of the messages in that chat for the first time in the article that was posted. I had no idea what all had been said, and it was disgusting. When the article came out I was shell-shocked. Some of those people I considered close friends.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;24.12.2018 08:52;0;0;I was not paying much attention to crypto. I was in many, many dozens of different rooms and discords and what have you. I was not very active in any of them. I had hundreds of unread messages. I was for the most part checked out and involved with issues IRL.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;24.12.2018 08:51;0;0;I understand people's concern, and I am myself deeply regretful for not taking the situation more seriously at the time. I honestly hadn't put any thought into it. At the time I was going through a very big transition in my life and very depressed.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;24.12.2018 08:49;0;3;and finally one last comment: There is a screenshot of a spreadsheet floating around with my name on it. I never once saw that spreadsheet myself.

TheCryptoDog;21.12.2018 00:50;2;18;Lol;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;21.12.2018 00:48;0;4;LMAO TBH AF;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;21.12.2018 00:42;0;2;Lol nah. I typically fast every day until mid/late afternoon. I don't eat strict Paleo but stick to solid home cooked meals. Eat out only once or twice a week.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;21.12.2018 00:39;1;28;The Story of Adidon was hands down the highlight of 2018. If you haven't had the chance to witness this feat, I encourage you to take a little time out of your day and indulge. It really was quite a spectacle.;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;21.12.2018 00:31;0;1;That's why I said most pizza. I LOVE a good pizza.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;21.12.2018 00:30;0;2;I spent time in the medical field and a majority of people are making their lives so much more painful and so much shorter. It's very sad.

TheCryptoDog;21.12.2018 00:22;0;5;Diabetes and hypertension aren't nice. Obesity isn't nice. Western diet is absolutely fucked and pizza is a great example of how we all just take it nonchalant. Teehee just eating this incredibly unhealthy piece of crap but it's ok bc it's just pizza.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;21.12.2018 00:19;4;104;Tbh most pizza is absolutely fucking disgusting. Cheap meat cheap cheese, loaded with sodium and grease. You people are all animals headed for a miserable end of your life riddled with chronic disease.;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;20.12.2018 20:37;0;2;It's always a concern when everyone is clinging to cash and risk appetite has all but soured, but that to me would be much more worrisome if Bitcoin's market cap were larger. So far I've not seen enough evidence of correlation, and at this point $71B is a drop in the bucket.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;20.12.2018 20:21;0;5;Mate that's because $4000-4500 is a heavy resistance, it's a bad spot to buy for short term - read up a few comments I just said it's a great place to hedge longs. This *is* a great place to buy spot for the long haul (years).;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;20.12.2018 20:20;5;83;Just now looking at all the charts - holy crap $ ETH hit $117? LMAO sick;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;20.12.2018 20:20;5;42;I haven't seen this much liquidity in ages. Yeah yeah, spoofy gonna spoof and this is just looking at a $20 spread, but god damn! I want to say this is really bullish.pic.twitter.com/aEEhO7qw4j;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;20.12.2018 20:09;14;281;8/ I look to mid 2019 and the 2020 halvening as a fundamental catalyst for further bullish momentum. (not to mention BAKKT, Fidelity, VanEck, etc,) Happy holidays everyone!;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;20.12.2018 20:07;14;168;7/ This time presents an incredible opportunity to begin to average into a position for the next bull cycle. There is no rush to buy all of your Bitcoin this very moment, but today IS a great time to begin accumulating Bitcoin as a long term investment.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;20.12.2018 20:07;19;162;6/ It is my opinion that Bitcoin is in the final stages of this bear market. I expect the price to range between an absolute low of $1800 to an absolute high of $6,200 (more likely, $3000-5400) for a substantial period of time.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;20.12.2018 20:07;4;67;"5/ $2800 still stands as a formidable support on break of new lows, which could very well still happen. The final bottom"" may be in. It may not. I leave you with the same message I left you with on my last market watch:""";;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;20.12.2018 20:06;5;73;4/ A break above $5650 and it is all but sure that we see another leg up to the low $6000s. It is highly unlikely we cross that barrier any time soon. Below us we look to $3700 and $3400 as intermediate supports, as well as the range low near $3100.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;20.12.2018 20:05;7;73;3/ If bulls are able to push past $4500, $4800 is the last bump in resistance that stands in the way before $5400. At this time I am not anticipating a rally beyond ~$5500, nor can I guarantee more relief even past $4500, though we must not count any scenario out.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;20.12.2018 20:05;3;71;2/ In just the last five days Bitcoin rallied 30%, with volume increasing on each subsequent leg. As I mentioned in my last market watch thread, the $4000-4500 block stands as a very strong resistance, lending itself now as an opportune price to begin to hedge long positions.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;20.12.2018 20:04;85;325;"1/ # Bitcoin found support near historical highs at $3,000.

TheCryptoDog;16.12.2018 22:31;0;0;The headline is especially damning for a reason. The author was very angry and wanted to do maximum damage to people he did not like.

TheCryptoDog;16.12.2018 22:26;0;0;The author took a message out of context where Coin Signals asked to join the Dog Pound and I obliged.

TheCryptoDog;16.12.2018 22:25;0;0;The writer of the article wrote it as a hit piece against Bitcoin Bravado (who was not involved at all).

TheCryptoDog;16.12.2018 22:24;0;1;A few things: Nothing ever materialized of their talks. I don't condone of any of it, and it made me take a very serious look at who and where I was associating.

TheCryptoDog;16.12.2018 22:21;1;16;I was not involved in a PND group. The group was originally a telegram chat for discussing TA. Coin Signals joined and as you can see suggested the idea to manipulate XHV. At the time I was in dozens of different telegram chats and not active in any of them.;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;13.12.2018 00:25;0;2;My biggest mistake on this trade I think was averaging into long too early - would have been much easier going holding my long if I had bid lower.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;13.12.2018 00:24;0;1;This was a case of me spending too much time on Twitter / Discord and letting myself be influenced by others. Learning from others is never a bad thing, and can often alert you to things you didn't see before.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;13.12.2018 00:22;2;87;On the one hand, I'm kicking myself for losing the entry and taking the small loss. Ultimately I should have stuck to the system I had in place.

TheCryptoDog;5.12.2018 03:06;0;1;Sorry I'm not good at threads;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;5.12.2018 03:05;25;216;There is no rush to buy all of your Bitcoin this very moment, but today IS a great time to begin accumulating Bitcoin as a long term investment. I look to mid 2019 and the 2020 halvening as a fundamental catalyst for further bullish momentum.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;5.12.2018 03:04;19;140;There is no reason to expect Bitcoin to rapidly enter a bull market from the bottom, it will take time. This time presents an incredible opportunity to begin to average into a position for the next bull cycle.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;5.12.2018 03:04;26;138;To investors looking for a signal in all of the noise: It is my opinion that Bitcoin is in the final stages of this bear market. I expect the price to range between an absolute low of $2000 to an absolute high of $6,200 (more likely, $3000-5400) for a substantial period of time.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;5.12.2018 03:03;7;41;Looking to the downside, it is possible buyers step in between 3400-3500 as they did last week to hold this range low, similar to how we saw 6,000 hold time and time again. However, a resounding break below 3500 and I target the next two major supports at $2800 & 3000.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;5.12.2018 03:03;3;26;However, if bulls muster a rally then we look to the range high for a break above 4500. From here there is just one moderate resistance to take into account at 4800, before we see a large volume gap up towards 5400.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;5.12.2018 03:01;48;255;Following the November sell off into the low 3000s, $ BTC has now carved out a clearly defined range between 3500 and 4500. A consolidation event following a strong move is more likely to result in a continuation than reversal. That means currently the bears are in control.pic.twitter.com/mW55d0hfOv;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;29.11.2018 18:50;13;67;On the bear side for $ BTC we have 6 consecutive hourly candles closed below key resistance. The highs were swept up to $4420, but there has not yet been the staying strength for a good close. If Bitcoin can't break 4350 again, $ ETH comes down as well.pic.twitter.com/kvjR2ZGF5O;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;29.11.2018 18:47;1;7;Good eye - yep. If $ BTC can't crack this resistance again, $ ETH looks apt to come back and re-test that ~$109 zone.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;29.11.2018 18:42;0;1;Not really if trading the $ ETH / $ USD pair then the ratio pair is not as much of a concern but rather how $ BTC performs vs $ USD. If BTC can break and hold above $4350, I'm bullish on ETH. Otherwise, I think they're both coming down.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;29.11.2018 18:35;1;3;Maybe like 40-45%? The chances are not negligible but I lean bullish.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;29.11.2018 18:28;9;29;The chart on $ ETH looks amazing, but as @fle_pie pointed out - $ BTC is still a concern. Until we see a stronger candle close above the current resistance ($4350-4400) on Bitcoin, ETH is not likely to perform.https://twitter.com/TheCryptoDog/status/1068193932964757504 …;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;29.11.2018 18:24;4;39;$ BTC set up is a little less clean than $ ETH. I don't like seeing the highs swept, but every pullback has been handily bought up. I was bearish on $ BTC until I saw 4090 rejected twice. I'm still not full bull, but get me a strong hourly close above $4350 and I'm eyeing $4750.pic.twitter.com/dDEQVfOR9R;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;29.11.2018 18:19;6;36;$ ETH consolidation is picturesque. Break out from here and I'm targeting $130 and ultimately $148. $137 may give us some trouble as well, but let's not get hung up in the small details just yet.pic.twitter.com/0qZfisjrbl;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;14.11.2018 23:44;14;133;A break of $5585 and I very much think we see $5800 soon, possibly as high as $5900-6000. A break of $6k would be incredible - not holding my breath. $ BTC $ BTCUSD # Bitcoinpic.twitter.com/ge6B2j50AJ;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;14.11.2018 23:30;8;48;Perhaps I'm just biased with my $ XRP short still open, but with # Ripple pumping on decreasing volume, I think this retraces soon vs $ BTC.pic.twitter.com/axI67HHoru;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;14.11.2018 23:23;9;126;Well, $6k wasn't the bottom, we know that now. I don't think the bottom is in yet, I am aiming for $4800-5000. I pray we don't drop further. Would be amazing to take care of this all in November.;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;14.11.2018 23:05;4;64;... and of course - I am just a dog on the internet, not a financial advisor. I could be wrong, don't bet the farm on $ BTC shorts.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;14.11.2018 23:04;32;205;Many are not chart professionals, and to those of you wondering: This was very unlikely to be the bottom. The volume and price action following is not in anyway indicative of a bottom being in. We will likely see $5,000 and upper $4000s in the coming days.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;14.11.2018 23:01;6;27;Not enough volume on this dump - we will go lower. We may not even touch $5800. $5k and upper $4000s is almost guaranteed in my eyes at this point.;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;9.11.2018 21:21;0;3;I really don't care about A&E or chart patterns that much at all. It's just a little frustrating seeing someone shit-talk them based off of a fundamental misunderstanding of how they work.;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;2.11.2018 09:48;3;13;@ CNBCFastMoney's caption was bait set out to trigger. You took the bait. Now we're all looking at this video they made. CNBC Fast Money: 1 Crypto Twitter: 0;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;2.11.2018 09:46;2;8;If you listen to the video he noted this is from a trader's perspective not investor's. He also said (I didn't verify) he called to derisk in August/Sept, and for this call to again derisk after mark up. So it sounds like he sold the top and now he's buying the dip for a flip.;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;31.10.2018 08:55;0;1;I'm not saying kratom is inherently dangerous or can't be used recreationally or medicinally. I think kratom can be a great tool for many people out there. It's still an opioid. Just not a particularly scary one.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;31.10.2018 08:54;0;0;You may be confusing opiates and opioids or may be this is an issue of semantics for you. Maybe you just need a way to divide kratom from other much more harmful opioids. Kratom exerts an appreciable agonistic effect on opioid receptors that results in symptoms like pain relief.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;31.10.2018 08:44;0;0;Brah mitragynine, the primary active ingredient in kratom, is a selective μ-opioid agonist. That's a fact. Chemicals in kratom 100% without a doubt show agonistic activity opioid receptors. Don't spread BS - actually study and understand how it works on a biochemical level.;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;30.10.2018 23:22;0;0;Your issue is that you do not want a truly open financial system. You much prefer systems where people transmit money through a third party, than directly.

TheCryptoDog;1.09.2018 03:16;23;220;IMO $ BTC bear market probably ended a long time ago and we've just been ranging ever since. $ ALTS however had much more fluff to exsanguinate.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;1.09.2018 03:11;0;3;Of course, there are many factors. But the top two are ambition and intelligence. Without those two your chances of success dwindle.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;1.09.2018 03:05;0;2;I do not regret a minute of my formal education. I learned countless valuable things through my time in school and am 10x a better person for it. But I applied myself and used the resources at hand. School is an infrastructure on which to further yourself. Use it wisely.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;1.09.2018 03:02;17;153;"One thing to keep in mind: Not everyone is blessed with intelligence. If you are and are able to achieve the success you desire, do not look down on the rest of the population for not being smart enough."" Achieve yours, and then look around to see what you can do for others.""";;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;1.09.2018 02:59;8;62;All you need is a stable internet connection, time, and ambition. No, not everyone has that yet. But opportunity is more available today than it ever has been before.;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;16.08.2018 00:34;0;1;From a medical practitioner's standpoint misuse is taking any drug in a manner outside of prescribed therapy. I do not agree that taking steroids to get bigger is inherently misuse. It can be, but not for that fact. Every patient, every human, has different goals in life.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;16.08.2018 00:31;0;1;Side effects are always a risk with any medication, however they can be greatly mitigated (potentially eliminated entirely) through a proper regimen. Everyone responds differently, and I ALWAYS recommend taking medication under the supervision of trained medical professional.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;16.08.2018 00:25;0;2;False. There is a limit to how much you can achieve naturally. While it's unlikely that Choe is there yet, there is a level at which you can no longer get any larger without steroids.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;16.08.2018 00:14;1;10;It is a common misconception that steroids are inherently dangerous. While they certainly can be misused and abused, there is an enormous history of professionals successfully taking them without sacrificing their health.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;16.08.2018 00:11;1;11;This can be done with minimal, if any, harm to general health and provides an incredible sense of well being. There are a number of doctors happy and willing to work with you on this to ensure you reach your goals safely and legally.;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;1.08.2018 07:07;0;3;I mean yeah, we know vaccines work because we literally don't get polio anymore. There is no debate whether or not vaccines work. We have over a century of evidence.

TheCryptoDog;1.08.2018 06:54;0;3;Yes, I am. I spent time in hospitals and it is required. I don't wish to engage you further beyond one point: Vaccines are not about you. They are about society.

TheCryptoDog;1.08.2018 06:40;1;6;I am genuinely surprised all of this is not common knowledge. It seems I have no idea what the average person does and doesn't know.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;1.08.2018 06:39;0;4;Not true - as someone elsewhere explained in the this thread, a young child not old enough for the vaccine (or an immunosupressed individual) could contract the disease from someone that didn't vaccinate and then die. This is why it is a selfish act.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;1.08.2018 06:37;0;1;Not just pharma but also medical device industry. There are a LOT of moving pieces. A lot of bad actors, and a lot of genuine honest people as well.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;1.08.2018 06:34;0;0;There is a large body of evidence that coronary stints in stable angina provide no medical benefit, yet doctors will often perform them because A) if they don't, the patient will get someone else to B) a patient may sue the doctor for not performing it (this has happened);;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;1.08.2018 06:30;0;1;I addressed this somewhere else but I think it got buried. In my tweet I am referring a minority of healthcare professionals, not a majority.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;1.08.2018 06:29;0;2;Yikes I'm coming on too strong and I didn't really explain very well, Sorry. Essentially the goal of a vaccine is to eradicate a disease from a population. Once people stop vaccinating, those diseases can come back and hurt other people.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;1.08.2018 06:25;1;12;Vaccines are not about the individual. The goal of the vaccine is not to keep YOU from getting sick. It's to keep SOCIETY from getting sick. It is a selfish act to put your own self above all other humans in society. You are not special.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;1.08.2018 06:24;0;0;Don't conflate pharma industry and the medical profession. The system is a monstrosity of so many moving pieces, and many people genuinely do put patient healthcare first.;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;1.08.2018 06:08;0;4;My first post refers to a minority of medical professionals, not a majority.

TheCryptoDog;28.07.2018 12:17;1;3;You are entirely right from a technical aspect. It's not about efficiency, the traditional system can handle that fine enough.

TheCryptoDog;19.05.2018 19:18;0;3;Uhhhhhhhhhh.........;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;19.05.2018 19:17;1;9;Told my homie a week ago don't start buying until 160;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;19.05.2018 19:14;1;57;Just curious, why do you think $ OCN will recover? Perhaps I just haven't looked into it enough myself but it always seemed like a shitcoin pump and dump from what I saw.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;19.05.2018 19:12;0;1;I did.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;19.05.2018 19:12;0;2;Professional degrees and STEM programs are a necessary part of society. I have seen it all in my path through education and of course recognize there are many merits. I love school.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;19.05.2018 09:50;1;29;Lol, yeah, I don't think the traditional education system had anything to do with his success.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;19.05.2018 09:49;0;0;Definitely not anything. There are fantastic programs and professors out there for all kinds of things you won't be able to extract from Youtube.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;19.05.2018 09:48;0;1;Sorry Scott, I was just making a joke.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;19.05.2018 08:26;1;18;Imagine a world where @ CarpeNoctom is a big blocker;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;19.05.2018 08:23;1;20;I'd be surprised if your best friend didn't come from a family making > $100k / yr;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;19.05.2018 08:21;0;0;100% agree.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;19.05.2018 05:45;0;0;"Right after I replied to you, your account became restricted."" Wtf is going on with Twitter""";;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;19.05.2018 05:34;0;1;Yes;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;19.05.2018 05:29;270;1190;The traditional education system is becoming a joke at an exponential rate. The self-taught will rule.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;19.05.2018 04:51;0;0;Uhh, thanks.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;19.05.2018 04:51;4;85;Major news corps asking for likes and subs on YouTube is the cringiest thing I've seen in the post-TV era.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;19.05.2018 03:53;1;20;Ehh I don't agree with you there. You can say it's a no trade zone and still clearly identify possibilities. No trade zone just means it's poor R/R to enter a trade, short or long, at that price.;;;;;;

Patience is the strongest tool in trading. If you can't handle sitting for a time without being in position, try a different profession.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;12.05.2018 01:23;2;42;I shorted $ BTC at 9900 a few days ago, covered too early at 9500. I've been fruitlessly longing from bullish support order blocks ever since, however every trade so far I have exited for a small profit. Stick to the rules and have no fear buying the dips.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;12.05.2018 01:21;52;216;Trading bitcoin with leverage is actually very easy if you follow a few simple rules: 1) Only open new positions at order blocks 2) Use limit orders 90% of the time for new positions 3) Watch volume after bounce / sell off 4) Move stops to profit / take profit if absent volume;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;12.05.2018 01:18;0;1;Compare the volume on the sell offs vs volume on the upswing. This is the clearest signal for determining a bottom.;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;20.04.2018 15:21;1;19;Today is # FF but don't get too carried away following new accounts. There are plenty of frauds, hacks, and scams out there that appear to be legitimate.https://twitter.com/TheCryptoDog/status/987317947994640384 …;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;20.04.2018 15:20;0;2;https://socialblade.com/twitter/user/davidgokhshtein/monthly … Just look at the follower activity on this account, then compare it to mine. Completely inorganic. The dude is a fraud trying to capitalize on the $ crypto frenzy. He's not an expert, just a marketing guy weaseling his way in. https://socialblade.com/twitter/user/thecryptodog/monthly …;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;20.04.2018 15:15;0;4;@ crypto_rand has a proven track record - I have been following him for over a year now. Choe showed up in December, teamed up with Philakone, and bought a zillion followers to appear more legitimate to sell his products and services. Same deal with David - but lower effort.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;20.04.2018 15:11;0;24;By the way I received this DM - and completely agree with the sentiment. I would not recommend following those guys, particularly David Gokhshtein. All three of them bought followers, but David looks to provide the least amount of actual good content between them all.pic.twitter.com/E8L5DU5pHZ;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;23.02.2018 09:43;0;3;Perhaps I could have been less colorful with the adjectives, sure. I have no concrete evidence of foul play, but from what I can see something appears off.

TheCryptoDog;23.02.2018 09:36;0;1;I'm not insulting anybody. From what I can tell Choe and Philakone are alright dudes and good traders. For instance, I respect Philakone's flair and off the wall sassy personality. I'm just pointing out the unusual social media activity surrounding their accounts.;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;17.02.2018 18:58;0;1;I kid you not, it was a very deliberate decision to brand as The Crypto Dog. I love dogs, and so do many other people.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;17.02.2018 18:55;0;0;Some people really do buy followers, I know one guy that showed me how he did. Me personally, I got my followers by memeing. Put a little effort into marketing yourself and you'll be surprised what kind of following you can get.;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;17.02.2018 18:33;1;10;"It has become in fashion to call just about anyone who has some following in crypto an OG. This is the use of OG"" that you are lamenting. There are though a handful of individuals who have been involved in crypto far longer than either of us who I consider OG.""";;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;17.02.2018 18:31;0;1;I agree, anyone who has to spout out that they are an OG is not one. But the fact remains that there are people exist that do indeed have experience that we lack. Coin whatever term you want for them, I have no problem calling them OGs.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;17.02.2018 18:27;0;7;There are people who have put much more time into crypto and therefore have significantly more experience than myself. I consider them OGs, sure. What is unsettling about that?;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;17.02.2018 18:05;0;6;Signals what? The problem is most people here think anyone with over 20k followers (or whatever the cut off is these days) is an OG. Real OGs have experience, knowledge, and connections that the rest of us simply don't have.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;17.02.2018 18:00;0;2;Who? Who are these OGs being dicks? Maybe I'm just not following the wrong people but I haven't been seeing any of this.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;17.02.2018 17:57;0;1;Bitcoin, sure. We have derivatives on respected exchanges. $ PEPE $ JEW $ DOGE Yes. Professional asset class indeed.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;17.02.2018 17:50;0;8;It is all a joke. It always has been.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;17.02.2018 17:47;0;5;Making millions of dollars in such a short amount of time off such a silly thing is absolutely ridiculous. Of course it's all a joke. How can you take any of this seriously?;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;17.02.2018 17:45;0;5;Crypto is run on memes. Nerds who grew up on the Internet in the 1990s and 2000s are now getting rich off of the silliest thing (crypto). This is not a professional asset class, it's a circus.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;17.02.2018 17:43;0;0;I've never heard someone describe someone as ordinary in a positive fashion.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;17.02.2018 17:40;0;0;No, that's really all it is at this point.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;17.02.2018 17:40;1;7;We're way beyond Satoshi's vision at this point. When I got into Bitcoin in 2011 it was because of 3 things: I was a nerd, I was poor, and I wanted to make money. The crypto markets are a device to transfer money from dumb and impatient to smart and patient. That's it.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;17.02.2018 17:30;0;8;Yes. Being in the game longer qualifies you as an OG. What did you think OG meant? An OG is someone who has been around much longer than the rest of us.;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;17.02.2018 17:24;0;3;It's a matter of wealth, understanding, and connections. It's also not really anything to do with arrogance. It's a meme, a joke. It's a silly thing to say. If anyone is using it in a derogatory fashion they're just an asshole.;;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;15.02.2018 23:33;0;0;Yikes;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;15.02.2018 23:30;0;0;Yes, to make a firm conclusion I do need a peer reviewed article. A systemic review would be fantastic. Connect as many dots as you like but without a body of literature confirming it it's just assumptions.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;15.02.2018 23:28;0;1;There are chemicals in our food and environment that are structurally similar enough to endogenous steroid hormones that they have some binding affinity for our steroid receptors. Thus our endocrine system may be disrupted.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;15.02.2018 23:27;0;1;Animal study. I've read plenty of them. Not denying the possible effects of phytoestrogens. But to assert they have a significant impact across a large population of male testosterone level decline is more than a stretch.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;15.02.2018 23:20;0;1;"It says right there in the article: Testosterone changes are largely explained by smoking behavior and changes in health status, particularly obesity and depression."" We are fat and sad. Also some people decide to smoke cigarettes too.""";;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;15.02.2018 23:19;0;1;To be clear, by no means am I shutting down the idea. I've read plenty of animal studies and endocrine disruptors are a real, messy thing. But there is not enough evidence yet to draw any firm conclusions on humans at this time.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;15.02.2018 23:18;0;1;"Although relative few adverse effects have been detected, that may simply be because a surprising paucity of large-scale, comprehensive studies have been undertaken to address this issue, especially in boys. "" Needs more research.""";;;;;;

TheCryptoDog;12.01.2018 23:54;0;9;Another handy trick: make note of the coin and check back in weeks/months later. A good pick once can be a good pick twice, all comes down to timing.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;12.01.2018 23:51;0;2;I take profits steadily through green days because I know there will inevitably be red days as well. Taking profits allows me build up portfolio in noncrypto investments and gives me plenty of ammo to buy more alts on red days.;;;;;;
TheCryptoDog;12.01.2018 23:34;0;1;You can set tight SL or sell early if you catch it while the dip first begins. When alts are bearish vs BTC (like they were July->Nov), this is necessary for most positions. Now the climate is different and so my trading style is more relaxed:;;;;;;
