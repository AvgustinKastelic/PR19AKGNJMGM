;2018-08-16 03:45;4;52;"66. I was very happy that the RPJ fork choice rule (which I have since renamed "immediate message-driven GHOST") is nicely compatible with Casper FFG in a way that most others are not...";;;;"1029906887376961536";https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029906887376961536
;2018-08-16 03:44;6;58;"65. Around this time I also managed to come up with a way to "pipeline" Casper FFG, reducing time-to-finality from 2.5 epochs to the theoretically optimal 2 epochs:https://ethresear.ch/t/beacon-chain-casper-ffg-rpj-mini-spec/2760 …";;;;"1029906835342385152";https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029906835342385152
;2018-08-16 03:44;4;56;"64. Vlad was very happy, though not fully: he preferred a version of GHOST based on validators' *latest messages*, whereas I preferred a version based on *immediate* messages:https://ethresear.ch/t/recursive-proximity-to-justification-as-ffg-fork-choice-rule/2561 …";;;;"1029906757512966144";https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029906757512966144

Justin Drake and I went off to solve this problem in two ways, Justin by using verifiable delay functions which have a deterministic and verifiable output, but take a large amount of unparallelizable sequential time to compute, making manipulation ahead of time impossible...";;;;"1029906603275825153";https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029906603275825153
;2018-08-16 03:43;9;75;"61. This was undesirable, primarily because it required us to have a strong source of on-chain random number generation to fairly pick the proposers.

;2018-08-16 03:43;6;62;"60. However, all of these approaches to the fork choice rule had a weakness: they split up validators into "attesters" and "proposers", and the proposers, being the key drivers of block production, had outsized power.";;;;"1029906472426041345";https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029906472426041345

;2018-08-16 03:41;9;78;"55. In June 2018, we made the fateful decision to scrap "hybrid Casper FFG as a contract", and instead pursue full Casper as an independent chain, designed in such a way that integrating sharding would be much easier.";;;;"1029905990085357568";https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029905990085357568
;2018-08-16 03:41;6;63;"54. In addition, the team's work was being split between "main chain Casper" and "shard chain Casper" and it was clear there was enormous unneeded duplication of effort going on between the Casper and sharding teams.";;;;"1029905938151432192";https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029905938151432192
;2018-08-16 03:40;7;70;"53. Unfortunately, development of FFG then slowed down. The decision to implement FFG as a contract made some things easier, but it made other things harder, and it also meant that the eventual switch from EVM to EWASM, and single-chain Casper to sharded Casper, would be harder.";;;;"1029905826641633281";https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029905826641633281
;2018-08-16 03:40;9;75;"52. In the meantime, Casper FFG was making huge progress. A decision to implement it as a contract that would be published to the Ethereum blockchain made development easy.

But, as is the Ethereum tradition, Vlad and I were both unaware that the word "ambitious" can be anything but a compliment, and kept on working on our separate approaches to disincentivizing, mitigating and recovering from 51% attacks.";;;;"1029905391813939200";https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029905391813939200
;2018-08-16 03:38;12;70;"49. It's worth noting here that all of these issues are not unique to proof of stake. In fact, in proof of work, people tend to simply give up and assume preventing 51% attacks is outright impossible, and a 51% attack is a doomsday that must be prevented at all costs.";;;;"1029905276164435968";https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029905276164435968

;2018-08-16 03:38;9;62;"47. In the meantime, my main criticism of Vlad's model had to do with "discouragement attacks", where attackers could credibly threaten to make a 51% attack that causes everyone to lose money, thereby driving everyone else to drop out, thus dominating the chain at near-zero cost";;;;"1029905171705344001";https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029905171705344001

It was something, but still suboptimal; unless network latency was exactly zero, there was only a guarantee that clients' suspicion scores would differ by at most delta, not that clients would fully agree.";;;;"1029905030990553088";https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029905030990553088
;2018-08-16 03:37;9;62;"45. Of course, I was well aware that appealing to the social layer to solve 51% attacks was not a very nice thing to do, so I started looking for ways to at least allow online clients to *automatically* detect which chain is "legitimate" and which is the "attack" in real time.";;;;"1029904909825495041";https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029904909825495041

There are basically 3 schools of thought on this issue: (i) Penalize both sides a little (ii) Penalize both sides hard (Vlad's preference) (iii) Split the chain into two, penalize one side on each chain, and let the market decide which chain is more valuable (my preference).";;;;"1029904677905739777";https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029904677905739777

;2018-08-16 03:33;7;59;"36. In the initial version of Casper FFG, proof of work would "run" the chain block-by-block, and the proof of stake would follow close behind to finalize blocks.

Vlad's initial preference for the fork choice rule was "latest message-driven GHOST", an adaptation of GHOST (https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/881.pdf ) to proof of stake, and my initial preference was to start off with hybrid PoS, using proof of work as the base fork choice rule.";;;;"1029903975061966850";https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029903975061966850
;2018-08-16 03:33;9;64;"34. In simplest terms, in Casper CBC the finality overlay adapts to the fork choice rule, whereas in Casper FFG the fork choice rule adapts to the finality overlay.";;;;"1029903882099482624";https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029903882099482624
