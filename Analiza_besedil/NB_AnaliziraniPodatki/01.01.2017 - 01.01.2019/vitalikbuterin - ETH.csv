2018-12-10 17:24;1;4;I'd say reduction of fixed costs. The human cost of maintaining whatever system you use greatly outweighs a couple pennies of transaction fees, so the framing that blockchains are this really expensive thing that requires great value to justify it is not really correct.;;;;1072165285304496128;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1072165285304496128;0.1283660921227009;0.8716339078773004

2018-12-10 17:20;64;418;15. Non-financial applications have a leg up over financial ones in one important sense: there is less at stake if they break, so fewer reasons to fear deploying them fairly quickly.

2018-12-10 17:18;53;306;14. Centralized servers can decide to change the rules later, they can get hacked, or they can just shut down if the company disappears.

2018-12-10 17:17;67;350;"13. Another interesting thing that blockchains give is the value of permanence.

2018-12-10 17:16;36;298;12. If layer 1 becomes cheap enough I literally foresee things like receipts of everyday purchases being published to blockchains.

2018-12-10 17:15;104;516;11. Computers have become 1 trillion times cheaper, per unit computation, in the last 70 years. Human labor has gotten 2-10x more expensive.

2018-12-10 17:13;308;995;10. Blockchains are NOT about cutting computational costs (at least relative to centralized servers). Blockchains are about incurring a sacrifice in the form of INCREASED computational costs to achieve a *decrease* in *social costs*.;;;;1072162427045736449;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1072162427045736449;0.9680110311349048;0.031988968865093316
2018-12-10 17:11;65;346;9. Blockchains of the future with proof of stake and sharding will be thousands of times more efficient, and so the efficiency sacrifices of putting things on a chain will become more and more acceptable.;;;;1072162014498148355;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1072162014498148355;0.5464760276486851;0.4535239723513123
2018-12-10 17:11;84;346;8. Public blockchains have a genuine competitive advantage over both centralized servers and consortium chains in credibly signaling neutrality. Right now it seems like benefits like this might not be worth the costs of public chains, but that's just the public chains of today...;;;;1072161771757088768;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1072161771757088768;0.8100851044088461;0.18991489559115257
2018-12-10 17:09;40;222;7. There are also many categories of use cases where different applications need to be on a common database, and it's just more convenient (or less risk of capture) if it's a credibly neutral platform. Supply chain tracing stuff theoretically falls here.;;;;1072161505443868672;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1072161505443868672;0.9802303794139935;0.01976962058600942
2018-12-10 17:08;38;230;6. Another category of use cases is verifying integrity of processes. For example, in an auction, you might want to verify that everyone's bid that was submitted on time was included, and no late bids were included. If bids are published to chain, even encrypted, you can do this.;;;;1072161050550710272;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1072161050550710272;0.49511137136493544;0.5048886286350603
2018-12-10 17:05;51;267;5. You can extend this to other contexts. A big one is key revocation in self-sovereign identity. If you have a key A, then you switch to key B, then key A is hacked later, how does someone you're interacting with no key A is no longer valid? Can check for revocations on chain.;;;;1072160446180810752;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1072160446180810752;0.07061865606229908;0.9293813439377041
2018-12-10 17:04;43;221;4. To check that a degree was not yet revoked, you simply scan the chain and check all of the logs of the revocation contract. If a given degree was signed, and the revocation is not found on chain, then that means it's still valid.;;;;1072160160594878465;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1072160160594878465;0.9288907555354204;0.07110924446457603
2018-12-10 17:03;65;330;"3. A simple example is a blockchain university degree verification app I saw recently.

2018-12-10 17:01;65;361;2. One underappreciated way to view blockchains is as an extension of cryptography that does different things.

2018-08-16 03:40;7;70;53. Unfortunately, development of FFG then slowed down. The decision to implement FFG as a contract made some things easier, but it made other things harder, and it also meant that the eventual switch from EVM to EWASM, and single-chain Casper to sharded Casper, would be harder.;;;;1029905826641633281;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029905826641633281;0.03661078067747978;0.9633892193225178
2018-08-16 03:40;9;75;52. In the meantime, Casper FFG was making huge progress. A decision to implement it as a contract that would be published to the Ethereum blockchain made development easy.

2018-08-16 03:39;13;94;51. In early 2018, Vlad's work on CBC started to move forward quickly, with great progess on safety proofs.

2018-08-16 03:38;12;70;49. It's worth noting here that all of these issues are not unique to proof of stake. In fact, in proof of work, people tend to simply give up and assume preventing 51% attacks is outright impossible, and a 51% attack is a doomsday that must be prevented at all costs.;;;;1029905276164435968;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029905276164435968;0.020225805793013994;0.9797741942069849

2018-08-16 03:36;9;99;42. There are basically 3 schools of thought on this issue: (i) Penalize both sides a little (ii) Penalize both sides hard (Vlad's preference) (iii) Split the chain into two, penalize one side on each chain, and let the market decide which chain is more valuable (my preference).;;;;1029904677905739777;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029904677905739777;0.004263517832851349;0.9957364821671473

2018-08-16 03:34;7;65;38.

2018-08-16 03:33;9;64;34. In simplest terms, in Casper CBC the finality overlay adapts to the fork choice rule, whereas in Casper FFG the fork choice rule adapts to the finality overlay.;;;;1029903882099482624;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029903882099482624;0.8118543285312998;0.18814567146869976

2018-08-16 03:32;22;138;31. Finality is a very significant advancement: once a block is finalized, it is secure regardless of network latency (unlike confirmations in PoW), and reverting the block requires >= 1/3 of validators to cheat in a way that's detectable and can be used to destroy their deposits;;;;1029903648728408064;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029903648728408064;0.25207240916047896;0.7479275908395244
2018-08-16 03:32;16;108;30.

2017-11-16 04:40;8;51;I do regret writing the tweet in that way. My goal was to express happiness that the portion of the bitcoin community that dislikes the mainline roadmap now has a clear alternative to crystallize around, and that it is doing so well.;;;;931004103974567936;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/931004103974567936;0.8827277568115307;0.11727224318846585

2017-11-16 04:21;4;6;BCH going up when 2x shut down was something I fully expected to happen. It's like if democratic party collapses, obviously Greens would grow massively.
